first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people all we knowt we knowt first citizen let us kill him and well have corn at our own price ist a verdict all no more talking ont let it be done away away second citizen one word good citizens first citizen we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularise their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge second citizen would you proceed especially against caius marcius all against him first hes a very dog to the commonalty second citizen consider you what services he has done for his country first citizen very well and could be content to give him good report fort but that he pays himself with being proud second citizen nay but speak not maliciously first citizen i say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though softconscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even till the altitude of his virtue second citizen what he cannot help in his nature you account a vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous first citizen if i must not i need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition what shouts are these the other side o the city is risen why stay we prating here to the capitol all come come first citizen soft who comes here second citizen worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved the people first citizen hes one honest enough would all the rest were so menenius what works my countrymen in hand where go you with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you first citizen our business is not unknown to the senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now well show em in deeds they say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too menenius why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours will you undo yourselves first citizen we cannot sir we are undone already menenius i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your suffering in this dearth you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms o the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies first citizen care for us true indeed they neer cared for us yet suffer us to famish and their storehouses crammed with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and theres all the love they bear us menenius either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale t a little more first citizen well ill hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but an t please you deliver menenius there was a time when all the bodys members rebelld against the belly thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i the midst o the body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labour with the rest where the other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body the belly answerd first citizen well sir what answer made the belly menenius sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile which neer came from the lungs but even thus for look you i may make the belly smile as well as speakit tauntingly replied to the discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipt even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you first citizen your bellys answer what the kinglycrowned head the vigilant eye the counsellor heart the arm our soldier our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter with other muniments and petty helps in this our fabric if that they menenius what then fore me this fellow speaks what then what then first citizen should by the cormorant belly be restraind who is the sink o the body menenius well what then first citizen the former agents if they did complain what could the belly answer menenius i will tell you if youll bestow a smallof what you have little patience awhile youll hear the bellys answer first citizen yere long about it menenius note me this good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answerd true is it my incorporate friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain and through the cranks and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friendsthis says the belly mark me first citizen ay sir well well menenius though all at once cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran what say you tot first citizen it was an answer how apply you this menenius the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal o the common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves what do you think you the great toe of this assembly first citizen i the great toe why the great toe menenius for that being one o the lowest basest poorest of this most wise rebellion thou gost foremost thou rascal that art worst in blood to run leadst first to win some vantage but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle the one side must have bale hail noble marcius marcius thanks whats the matter you dissentious rogues that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion make yourselves scabs first citizen we have ever your good word marcius he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would you have you curs that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland whats the matter that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another whats their seeking menenius for corn at their own rates whereof they say the city is well stored marcius hang em they say theyll sit by the fire and presume to know whats done i the capitol whos like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes they say theres grain enough would the nobility lay aside their ruth and let me use my sword ill make a quarry with thousands of these quarterd slaves as high as i could pick my lance menenius nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded for though abundantly they lack discretion yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you what says the other troop marcius they are dissolved hang em they said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings which being answerd and a petition granted them a strange one to break the heart of generosity and make bold power look palethey threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o the moon shouting their emulation menenius what is granted them marcius five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms of their own choice ones junius brutus sicinius velutus and i know notsdeath the rabble should have first unroofd the city ere so prevaild with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrections arguing menenius this is strange marcius go get you home you fragments messenger wheres caius marcius marcius here whats the matter messenger the news is sir the volsces are in arms marcius i am glad on t then we shall ha means to vent our musty superfluity see our best elders first senator marcius tis true that you have lately told us the volsces are in arms marcius they have a leader tullus aufidius that will put you to t i sin in envying his nobility and were i any thing but what i am i would wish me only he cominius you have fought together marcius were half to half the world by the ears and he upon my party ild revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt first senator then worthy marcius attend upon cominius to these wars cominius it is your former promise marcius sir it is and i am constant titus lartius thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus face what art thou stiff standst out titus no caius marcius ill lean upon one crutch and fight with tother ere stay behind this business menenius o truebred first senator your company to the capitol where i know our greatest friends attend us titus cominius noble marcius first senator marcius nay let them follow the volsces have much corn take these rats thither to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners your valour puts well forth pray follow sicinius was ever man so proud as is this marcius brutus he has no equal sicinius when we were chosen tribunes for the people brutus markd you his lip and eyes sicinius nay but his taunts brutus being moved he will not spare to gird the gods sicinius bemock the modest moon brutus the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant sicinius such a nature tickled with good success disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius brutus fame at the which he aims in whom already hes well graced can not better be held nor more attaind than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the generals fault though he perform to the utmost of a man and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius o if he had borne the business sicinius besides if things go well opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius brutus come half all cominius honours are to marcius though marcius earned them not and all his faults to marcius shall be honours though indeed in aught he merit not sicinius lets hence and hear how the dispatch is made and in what fashion more than his singularity he goes upon this present action brutus lets along first senator so your opinion is aufidius that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed aufidius is it not yours what ever have been thought on in this state that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention tis not four days gone since i heard thence these are the words i think i have the letter here yes here it is they have pressd a power but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great the people mutinous and it is rumourd cominius marcius your old enemy who is of rome worse hated than of you and titus lartius a most valiant roman these three lead on this preparation whither tis bent most likely tis for you consider of it first senator our armys in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us aufidius nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veild till when they needs must show themselves which in the hatching it seemd appeard to rome by the discovery we shall be shortend in our aim which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot second senator noble aufidius take your commission hie you to your bands let us alone to guard corioli if they set down before s for the remove bring your army but i think youll find theyve not prepared for us aufidius o doubt not that i speak from certainties nay more some parcels of their power are forth already and only hitherward i leave your honours if we and caius marcius chance to meet tis sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more all the gods assist you aufidius and keep your honours safe first senator farewell second senator farewell all farewell volumnia i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love when yet he was but tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honour would become such a person that it was no better than picturelike to hang by the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man virgilia but had he died in the business madam how then volumnia then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action gentlewoman madam the lady valeria is come to visit you virgilia beseech you give me leave to retire myself volumnia indeed you shall not methinks i hear hither your husbands drum see him pluck aufidius down by the hair as children from a bear the volsces shunning him methinks i see him stamp thus and call thus come on you cowards you were got in fear though you were born in rome his bloody brow with his maild hand then wiping forth he goes like to a harvestman thats taskd to mow or all or lose his hire virgilia his bloody brow o jupiter no blood volumnia away you fool it more becomes a man than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba when she did suckle hector lookd not lovelier than hectors forehead when it spit forth blood at grecian sword contemning tell valeria we are fit to bid her welcome virgilia heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius volumnia hell beat

mine edge marcius all the contagion of the south light on you you shames of rome you herd ofboils and plagues plaster you oer that you may be abhorrd further than seen and one infect another against the wind a mile you souls of geese that bear the shapes of men how have you run from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell all hurt behind backs red and faces pale with flight and agued fear mend and charge home or by the fires of heaven ill leave the foe and make my wars on you look tot come on if youll stand fast well beat them to their wives as they us to our trenches followed so now the gates are ope now prove good seconds tis for the followers fortune widens them not for the fliers mark me and do the like first soldier foolhardiness not i second soldier nor i first soldier see they have shut him in all to the pot i warrant him lartius what is become of marcius all slain sir doubtless first soldier following the fliers at the very heels with them he enters who upon the sudden clappd to their gates he is himself alone to answer all the city lartius o noble fellow who sensibly outdares his senseless sword and when it bows stands up thou art left marcius a carbuncle entire as big as thou art were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier even to catos wish not fierce and terrible only in strokes but with thy grim looks and the thunderlike percussion of thy sounds thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world were feverous and did tremble first soldier look sir lartius otis marcius lets fetch him off or make remain alike first roman this will i carry to rome second roman and i this third roman a murrain ont i took this for silver marcius see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crackd drachm cushions leaden spoons irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them these base slaves ere yet the fight be done pack up down with them and hark what noise the general makes to him there is the man of my souls hate aufidius piercing our romans then valiant titus take convenient numbers to make good the city whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste to help cominius lartius worthy sir thou bleedst thy exercise hath been too violent for a second course of fight marcius sir praise me not my work hath yet not warmd me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear and fight lartius now the fair goddess fortune fall deep in love with thee and her great charms misguide thy opposers swords bold gentleman prosperity be thy page marcius thy friend no less than those she placeth highest so farewell lartius thou worthiest marcius go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace call thither all the officers o the town where they shall know our mind away cominius breathe you my friends well fought we are come off like romans neither foolish in our stands nor cowardly in retire believe me sirs we shall be charged again whiles we have struck by interims and conveying gusts we have heard the charges of our friends ye roman gods lead their successes as we wish our own that both our powers with smiling fronts encountering may give you thankful sacrifice thy news messenger the citizens of corioli have issued and given to lartius and to marcius battle i saw our party to their trenches driven and then i came away cominius though thou speakst truth methinks thou speakst not well how long ist since messenger above an hour my lord cominius tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour and bring thy news so late messenger spies of the volsces held me in chase that i was forced to wheel three or four miles about else had i sir half an hour since brought my report cominius whos yonder that does appear as he were flayd o gods he has the stamp of marcius and i have beforetime seen him thus marcius cominius the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour more than i know the sound of marcius tongue from every meaner man marcius come i too late cominius ay if you come not in the blood of others but mantled in your own marcius o let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i wood in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done and tapers burnd to bedward cominius flower of warriors how is it with titus lartius marcius as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death and some to exile ransoming him or pitying threatening the other holding corioli in the name of rome even like a fawning greyhound in the leash to let him slip at will cominius where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches where is he call him hither marcius let him alone he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen the common filea plague tribunes for them the mouse neer shunnd the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they cominius but how prevaild you marcius will the time serve to tell i do not think where is the enemy are you lords o the field if not why cease you till you are so cominius marcius we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose marcius how lies their battle know you on which side they have placed their men of trust cominius as i guess marcius their bands i the vaward are the antiates of their best trust oer them aufidius their very heart of hope marcius i do beseech you by all the battles wherein we have fought by the blood we have shed together by the vows we have made to endure friends that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates and that you not delay the present but filling the air with swords advanced and darts we prove this very hour cominius though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action marcius those are they that most are willing if any such be here as it were sin to doubtthat love this painting wherein you see me smeard if any fear lesser his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his countrys dearer than himself let him alone or so many so minded wave thus to express his disposition and follow marcius o me alone make you a sword of me if these shows be not outward which of you but is four volsces none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his a certain number though thanks to all must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight as cause will be obeyd please you to march and four shall quickly draw out my command which men are best inclined cominius march on my fellows make good this ostentation and you shall divide in all with us lartius so let the ports be guarded keep your duties as i have set them down if i do send dispatch those centuries to our aid the rest will serve for a short holding if we lose the field we cannot keep the town lieutenant fear not our care sir lartius hence and shut your gates upons our guider come to the roman camp conduct us marcius ill fight with none but thee for i do hate thee worse than a promisebreaker aufidius we hate alike not afric owns a serpent i abhor more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot marcius let the first budger die the others slave and the gods doom him after aufidius if i fly marcius holloa me like a hare marcius within these three hours tullus alone i fought in your corioli walls and made what work i pleased tis not my blood wherein thou seest me maskd for thy revenge wrench up thy power to the highest aufidius wert thou the hector that was the whip of your braggd progeny thou shouldst not scape me here officious and not valiant you have shamed me in your condemned seconds cominius if i should tell thee oer this thy days work thouldst not believe thy deeds but ill report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles where great patricians shall attend and shrug i the end admire where ladies shall be frighted and gladly quaked hear more where the dull tribunes that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours shall say against their hearts we thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast having fully dined before lartius o general here is the steed we the caparison hadst thou beheld marcius pray now no more my mother who has a charter to extol her blood when she does praise me grieves me i have done as you have done thats what i can induced as you have been thats for my country he that has but effected his good will hath overtaen mine act cominius you shall not be the grave of your deserving rome must know the value of her own twere a concealment worse than a theft no less than a traducement to hide your doings and to silence that which to the spire and top of praises vouchd would seem but modest therefore i beseech you in sign of what you are not to reward what you have donebefore our army hear me marcius i have some wounds upon me and they smart to hear themselves rememberd cominius should they not well might they fester gainst ingratitude and tent themselves with death of all the horses whereof we have taen good and good store of all the treasure in this field achieved and city we render you the tenth to be taen forth before the common distribution at your only choice marcius i thank you general but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing marcius may these same instruments which you profane never sound more when drums and trumpets shall i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be made all of falsefaced soothing when steel grows soft as the parasites silk let him be made a coverture for the wars no more i say for that i have not washd my nose that bled or foild some debile wretch which without note heres many else have done you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies cominius too modest are you more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly by your patience if gainst yourself you be incensed well put you like one that means his proper harm in manacles then reason safely with you therefore be it known as to us to all the world that caius marcius wears this wars garland in token of the which my noble steed known to the camp i give him with all his trim belonging and from this time for what he did before corioli call him with all the applause and clamour of the host caius marcius coriolanus bear the addition nobly ever all caius marcius coriolanus coriolanus i will go wash and when my face is fair you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit i thank you i mean to stride your steed and at all times to undercrest your good addition to the fairness of my power cominius so to our tent where ere we do repose us we will write to rome of our success you titus lartius must to corioli back send us to rome the best with whom we may articulate for their own good and ours lartius i shall my lord coriolanus the gods begin to mock me i that now refused most princely gifts am bound to beg of my lord general cominius taket tis yours what ist coriolanus i sometime lay here in corioli at a poor mans house he used me kindly he cried to me i saw him prisoner but then aufidius was within my view and wrath oerwhelmd my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom cominius o well beggd were he the butcher of my son he should be free as is the wind deliver him titus lartius marcius his name coriolanus by jupiter forgot i am weary yea my memory is tired have we no wine here cominius go we to our tent the blood upon your visage dries tis time it should be lookd to come aufidius the town is taen first soldier twill be deliverd back on good condition aufidius condition i would i were a roman for i cannot being a volsce be that i am condition what good condition can a treaty find i the part that is at mercy five times marcius i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me and wouldst do so i think should we encounter as often as we eat by the elements if eer again i meet him beard to beard hes mine or i am his mine emulation hath not that honour int it had for where i thought to crush him in an equal force true sword to sword ill potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him first soldier hes the devil aufidius bolder though not so subtle my valours poisond with only suffering stain by him for him shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary being naked sick nor fane nor capitol the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice embarquements all of fury shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom gainst my hate to marcius where i find him were it at home upon my brothers guard even there against the hospitable canon would i wash my fierce hand ins heart go you to the city learn how tis held and what they are that must be hostages for rome first soldier will not you go aufidius i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you tis south the city millsbring me word thither how the world goes that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey first soldier i shall sir menenius the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight brutus good or bad menenius not according to the prayer of the people for they love not marcius sicinius nature teaches beasts to know their friends menenius pray you who does the wolf love sicinius the lamb menenius ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius brutus hes a lamb indeed that baes like a bear menenius hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you both well sir menenius in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance brutus hes poor in no one fault but stored with all sicinius especially in pride brutus and topping all others in boasting menenius this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city i mean of us o the righthand file do you both why how are we censured menenius because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry both well well sir well menenius why tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for being proud brutus we do it not alone sir menenius i know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves o that you could brutus what then sir menenius why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as any in rome sicinius menenius you are known well enough too menenius i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber int said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink you give me touch my palate adversely i make a crooked face at it i cant say your worships have delivered the matter well when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces if you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known well enough too what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if i be known well enough too brutus come sir come we know you well enough menenius you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you are ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience when you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinched with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves you are a pair of strange ones brutus come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol menenius our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors since deucalion though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you how now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow your eyes so fast volumnia honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for the love of juno lets go menenius ha marcius coming home volumnia ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous approbation menenius take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo marcius coming home volumnia naytis true volumnia look heres a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and i think theres one at home for you menenius i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me virgilia yes certain theres a letter for you i sawt menenius a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years health in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horsedrench is he not wounded he was wont to come home wounded virgilia o no no no volumnia o he is wounded i thank the gods fort menenius so do i too if it be not too much brings a victory in his pocket the wounds become him volumnia ons brows menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland menenius has he disciplined aufidius soundly volumnia titus lartius writes they fought together but aufidius got off menenius and twas time for him too ill warrant him that an he had stayed by him i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold thats in them is the senate possessed of this volumnia good ladies lets go yes yes yes the senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly valeria in troth theres wondrous things spoke of him menenius wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his true purchasing virgilia the gods grant them true volumnia true pow wow menenius true ill be sworn they are true where is he wounded god save your good worships marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud where is he wounded volumnia i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i the body menenius one i the neck and two i the thightheres nine that i know volumnia he had before this last expedition twentyfive wounds upon him menenius now its twentyseven every gash was an enemys grave hark the trumpets volumnia these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries noise and behind him he leaves tears death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie which being advanced declines and then men die herald know rome that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates where he hath won with fame a name to caius marcius these in honour follows coriolanus welcome to rome renowned coriolanus all welcome to rome renowned coriolanus coriolanus no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more cominius look sir your mother coriolanus o you have i know petitiond all the gods for my prosperity volumnia nay my good soldier up my gentle marcius worthy caius and by deedachieving honour newly named what is itcoriolanus must i call thee but o thy wife coriolanus my gracious silence hail wouldst thou have laughd had i come coffind home that weepst to see me triumph ay my dear such eyes the widows in corioli wear and mothers that lack sons menenius now the gods crown thee coriolanus and live you yet o my sweet lady pardon volumnia i know not where to turn o welcome home and welcome general and yere welcome all menenius a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome a curse begin at very root ons heart that is not glad to see thee you are three that rome should dote on yet by the faith of men we have some old crabtrees here at home that will not be grafted to your relish yet welcome warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly cominius ever right coriolanus menenius ever ever herald give way there and go on coriolanus volumnia i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only theres one thing wanting which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee coriolanus know good mother i had rather be their servant in my way than sway with them in theirs cominius on to the capitol brutus all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram bout her reechy neck clambering the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows are smotherd up leads filld and ridges horsed with variable complexions all agreeing in earnestness to see him seldshown flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station or veild dames commit the war of white and damask in their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture sicinius on the sudden i warrant him consul brutus then our office may during his power go sleep sicinius he cannot temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end but will lose those he hath won brutus in that theres comfort sicinius doubt not the commoners for whom we stand but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to dot brutus i heard him swear were he to stand for consul never would he appear i the marketplace nor on him put the napless vesture of humility nor showing as the manner is his wounds to the people beg their stinking breaths sicinius tis right brutus it was his word o he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him and the desire of the nobles sicinius i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution brutus tis most like he will sicinius it shall be to him then as our good wills a sure destruction brutus so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them that tos power he would have made them mules silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms holding them in human action and capacity of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war who have their provand only for bearing burdens and sore blows for sinking under them sicinius this as you say suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want if he be put upon t and thats as easy as to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze shall darken him for ever brutus whats the matter messenger you are sent for to the capitol tis thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers upon him as he passd the nobles bended as to joves statue and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like brutus lets to the capitol and carry with us ears and eyes for the time but hearts for the event sicinius have with you first officer come come they are almost here how many stand for consulships second officer three they say but tis thought of every one coriolanus will carry it first officer thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and loves not the common people second officer faith there had been many great men that have flattered the people who neer loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground therefore for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly seet first officer if he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to flatter them for their love second officer he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it first officer no more of him he is a worthy man make way they are coming menenius having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius it remains as the main point of this our aftermeeting to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore please you most reverend and grave elders to desire the present consul and last general in our wellfound successes to report a little of that worthy work performd by caius marcius coriolanus whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself first senator speak good cominius leave nothing out for length and make us think rather our states defective for requital than we to stretch it out masters o the people we do request your kindest ears and after your loving motion toward the common body to yield what passes here sicinius we are convented upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly brutus which the rather we shall be blest to do if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at menenius thats off thats off i would you rather had been silent please you to hear cominius speak brutus most willingly but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it menenius he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow worthy cominius speak nay keep your place first senator sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done coriolanus your horrors pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them brutus sir i hope my words disbenchd you not coriolanus no sir yet oft when blows have made me stay i fled from words you soothed not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh menenius pray now sit down coriolanus i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monsterd menenius masters of the people your multiplying spawn how can he flatter thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius cominius i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utterd feebly it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue and most dignifies the haver if it be the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised at sixteen years when tarquin made a head for rome he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator whom with all praise i point at saw him fight when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him be bestrid an oerpressd roman and i the consuls view slew three opposers tarquins self he met and struck him on his knee in that days feats when he might act the woman in the scene he proved best man i the field and for his meed was browbound with the oak his pupil age manenterd thus he waxed like a sea and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurchd all swords of the garland for this last before and in corioli let me say i cannot speak him home he stoppd the fliers and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail so men obeyd and fell below his stem his sword deaths stamp where it did mark it took from face to foot he was a thing of blood whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enterd the mortal gate of the city which he painted with shunless destiny aidless came off and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet now alls his when by and by the din of war gan pierce his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit requickend what in flesh was fatigate and to the battle came he where he did run reeking oer the lives of men as if twere a perpetual spoil and till we calld both field and city ours he never stood to ease his breast with panting menenius worthy man first senator he cannot but with measure fit the honours which we devise him cominius our spoils he kickd at and lookd upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend the time to end it menenius hes right noble let him be calld for first senator call coriolanus officer he doth appear menenius the senate coriolanus are well pleased to make thee consul coriolanus i do owe them still my life and services menenius it then remains that you do speak to the people coriolanus i do beseech you let me oerleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing sicinius sir the people must have their voices neither will they bate one jot of ceremony menenius put them not tot pray you go fit you to the custom and take to you as your predecessors have your honour with your form coriolanus it is apart that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people brutus mark you that coriolanus to brag unto them thus i did and thus show them the unaching scars which i should hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only menenius do not stand upont we recommend to you tribunes of the people our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour senators to coriolanus come all joy and honour brutus you see how he intends to use the people sicinius may they perceives intent he will require them as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give brutus come well inform them of our proceedings here on the marketplace i know they do attend us first citizen once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him second citizen we may sir if we will third citizen we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members first citizen and to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude third citizen we have been called so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some auburn some bald but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o the compass second citizen think you so which way do you judge my wit would fly third citizen nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans willtis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but if it were at liberty twould sure southward second citizen why that way third citizen to lose itself in a fog where being three parts melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife second citizen you are never without your tricks you may you may third citizen are you all resolved to give your voices but thats no matter the greater part carries it i say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man here he comes and in the gown of humility mark his behavior we are not to stay all together but to come by him where he stands by ones by twos and by threes hes to make his requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me and i direct you how you shall go by him all content content menenius o sir you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have donet coriolanus what must i say i pray sirplague upont i cannot bring my tongue to such a pacelook sir my wounds i got them in my countrys service when some certain of your brethren roard and ran from the noise of our own drums menenius o me the gods you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you coriolanus think upon me hang em i would they would forget me like the virtues which our divines lose by em menenius youll mar all ill leave you pray you speak to em i pray you in wholesome manner coriolanus bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean so here comes a brace you know the cause air of my standing here third citizen we do sir tell us what hath brought you tot coriolanus mine own desert second citizen your own desert coriolanus ay but not mine own desire third citizen how not your own desire coriolanus no sirtwas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging third citizen you must think if we give you any thing we hope to gain by you coriolanus well then i pray your price o the consulship first citizen the price is to ask it kindly coriolanus kindly sir i pray let me hat i have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private your good voice sir what say you second citizen you shall ha it worthy sir coriolanus a match sir theres in all two worthy voices begged i have your alms adieu third citizen but this is something odd second citizen an twere to give againbut tis no matter coriolanus pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul i have here the customary gown fourth citizen you have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly coriolanus your enigma fourth citizen you have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved the common people coriolanus you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love i will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you i may be consul fifth citizen we hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily fourth citizen you have received many wounds for your country coriolanus i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further both citizens the gods give you joy sir heartily coriolanus most sweet voices better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish toge should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless vouches custom calls me tot what custom wills in all things should we dot the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to oerpeer rather than fool it so let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus i am half through the one part sufferd the other will i do here come more voices your voices for your voices i have fought watchd for your voices for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six i have seen and heard of for your voices have done many things some less some more your voices indeed i would be consul sixth citizen he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest mans voice seventh citizen therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people all citizens amen amen god save thee noble consul coriolanus worthy voices menenius you have stood your limitation and the tribunes endue you with the peoples voice remains that in the official marks invested you anon do meet the senate coriolanus is this done sicinius the custom of request you have discharged the people do admit you and are summond to meet anon upon your approbation coriolanus where at the senatehouse sicinius there coriolanus coriolanus may i change these garments sicinius you may sir coriolanus that ill straight do and knowing myself again repair to the senatehouse menenius ill keep you company will you along brutus we stay here for the people sicinius fare you well he has it now and by his looks methink tis warm at s heart brutus with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds will you dismiss the people sicinius how now my masters have you chose this man first citizen he has our voices sir brutus we pray the gods he may deserve your loves second citizen amen sir to my poor unworthy notice he mockd us when he beggd our voices third citizen certainly he flouted us downright first citizen notis his kind of speech he did not mock us second citizen not one amongst us save yourself but says he used us scornfully he should have showd us his marks of merit wounds received fors country sicinius why so he did i am sure citizens no no no man saw em third citizen he said he had wounds which he could show in private and with his hat thus waving it in scorn i would be consul says he aged custom but by your voices will not so permit me your voices therefore when we granted that here was i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices i have no further with you was not this mockery sicinius why either were you ignorant to seet or seeing it of such childish friendliness to yield your voices brutus could you not have told him as you were lessond when he had no power but was a petty servant to the state he was your enemy ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i the body of the weal and now arriving a place of potency and sway o the state if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii your voices might be curses to yourselves you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love standing your friendly lord sicinius thus to have said as you were foreadvised had touchd his spirit and tried his inclination from him pluckd either his gracious promise which you might as cause had calld you up have held him to or else it would have galld his surly nature which easily endures not article tying him to aught so putting him to rage you should have taen the advantage of his choler and passd him unelected brutus did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you when he hath power to crush why had your bodies no heart among you or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment sicinius have you ere now denied the asker and now again of him that did not ask but mock bestow your suedfor tongues third citizen hes not confirmd we may deny him yet second citizen and will deny him ill have five hundred voices of that sound first citizen i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em brutus get you hence instantly and tell those friends they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so sicinius let them assemble and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election enforce his pride and his old hate unto you besides forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed how in his suit he scornd you but your loves thinking upon his services took from you the apprehension of his present portance which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you brutus lay a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured no impediment between but that you must cast your election on him sicinius say you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections and that your minds preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us brutus ay spare us not say we read lectures to you how youngly he began to serve his country how long continued and what stock he springs of the noble house o the marcians from whence came that ancus marcius numas daughters son who after great hostilius here was king of the same house publius and quintus were that our beat water brought by conduits hither and twice being was his great ancestor sicinius one thus descended that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place we did commend to your remembrances but you have found scaling his present bearing with his past that hes your fixed enemy and revoke your sudden approbation brutus say you neer had donet harp on that stillbut by our putting on and presently when you have drawn your number repair to the capitol all we will so almost all repent in their election brutus let them go on this mutiny were better put in hazard than stay past doubt for greater if as his nature is he fall in rage with their refusal both observe and answer the vantage of his anger sicinius to the capitol come we will be there before the stream o the people and this shall seem as partly tis their own which we have goaded onward coriolanus tullus aufidius then had made new head lartius he had my lord and that it was which caused our swifter composition coriolanus so then the volsces stand but as at first ready when time shall prompt them to make road upons again cominius they are worn lord consul so that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again coriolanus saw you aufidius lartius on safeguard he came to me and did curse against the volsces for they had so vilely yielded the town he is retired to antium coriolanus spoke he of me lartius he did my lord coriolanus how what lartius how often he had met you sword to sword that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution so he might be calld your vanquisher coriolanus at antium lives he lartius at antium coriolanus i wish i had a cause to seek him there to oppose his hatred fully welcome home behold these are the tribunes of the people the tongues o the common mouth i do despise them for they do prank them in authority against all noble sufferance sicinius pass no further coriolanus ha what is that brutus it will be dangerous to go on no further coriolanus what makes this change menenius the matter cominius hath he not passd the noble and the common brutus cominius no coriolanus have i had childrens voices first senator tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace brutus the people are incensed against him sicinius stop or all will fall in broil coriolanus are these your herd must these have voices that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues what are your offices you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth have you not set them on menenius be calm be calm coriolanus it is a purposed thing and grows by plot to curb the will of the nobility suffert and live with such as cannot rule nor ever will be ruled brutus callt not a plot the people cry you mockd them and of late when corn was given them gratis you repined scandald the suppliants for the people calld them timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness coriolanus why this was known before brutus not to them all coriolanus have you informd them sithence brutus how i inform them coriolanus you are like to do such business brutus not unlike each way to better yours coriolanus why then should i be consul by yond clouds let me deserve so ill as you and make me your fellow tribune sicinius you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound you must inquire your way which you are out of with a gentler spirit or never be so noble as a consul nor yoke with him for tribune menenius lets be calm cominius the people are abused set on this paltering becomes not rome nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonourd rub laid falsely i the plain way of his merit coriolanus tell me of corn this was my speech and i will speakt again menenius not now not now first senator not in this heat sir now coriolanus now as i live i will my nobler friends i crave their pardons for the mutable rankscented many let them regard me as i do not flatter and therein behold themselves i say again in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition which we ourselves have ploughd for sowd and scatterd by mingling them with us the honourd number who lack not virtue no nor power but that which they have given to beggars menenius well no more first senator no more words we beseech you coriolanus how no more as for my country i have shed my blood not fearing outward force so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles which we disdain should tatter us yet sought the very way to catch them brutus you speak o the people as if you were a god to punish not a man of their infirmity sicinius twere well we let the people knowt menenius what what his choler coriolanus choler were i as patient as the midnight sleep by jove twould be my mind sicinius it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is not poison any further coriolanus shall remain hear you this triton of the minnows mark you his absolute shall cominius twas from the canon coriolanus shall o good but most unwise patricians why you grave but reckless senators have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer that with his peremptory shall being but the horn and noise o the monsters wants not spirit to say hell turn your current in a ditch and make your channel his if he have power then vail your ignorance if none awake your dangerous lenity if you are learnd be not as common fools if you are not let them have cushions by you you are plebeians if they be senators and they are no less when both your voices blended the greatst taste most palates theirs they choose their magistrate and such a one as he who puts his shall his popular shall against a graver bench than ever frown in greece by jove himself it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know when two authorities are up neither supreme how soon confusion may enter twixt the gap of both and take the one by the other cominius well on to the marketplace coriolanus whoever gave that counsel to give forth the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used sometime in greece menenius well well no more of that coriolanus though there the people had more absolute power i say they nourishd disobedience fed the ruin of the state brutus why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice coriolanus ill give my reasons more worthier than their voices they know the corn was not our recompense resting well assured that neer did service fort being pressd to the war even when the navel of the state was touchd they would not thread the gates this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis being i the war their mutinies and revolts wherein they showd most valour spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate all cause unborn could never be the motive of our so frank donation well what then how shall this bisson multitude digest the senates courtesy let deeds express whats like to be their words we did request it we are the greater poll and in true fear they gave us our demands thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears which will in time break ope the locks o the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles menenius come enough brutus enough with overmeasure coriolanus no take more what may be sworn by both divine and human seal what i end withal this double worship where one part does disdain with cause the other insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignoranceit must omit real necessities and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barrd it follows nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you you that will be less fearful than discreet that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change ont that prefer a noble life before a long and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic thats sure of death without it at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should becomet not having the power to do the good it would for the in which doth controlt brutus has said enough sicinius has spoken like a traitor and shall answer as traitors do coriolanus thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee what should the people do with these bald tribunes on whom depending their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion when whats not meet but what must be was law then were they chosen in a better hour let what is meet be said it must be meet and throw their power i the dust brutus manifest treason sicinius this a consul no brutus the aediles ho let him be apprehended sicinius go call the people in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator a foe to the public weal obey i charge thee and follow to thine answer coriolanus hence old goat senators c well surety him cominius aged sir hands off coriolanus hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments sicinius help ye citizens menenius on both sides more respect sicinius heres he that would take from you all your power brutus seize him aediles citizens down with him down with him senators c weapons weapons weapons tribunes patricians citizens what ho sicinius brutus coriolanus citizens peace peace peace stay hold peace menenius what is about to be i am out of breath confusions near i cannot speak you tribunes to the people coriolanus patience speak good sicinius sicinius hear me people peace citizens lets hear our tribune peace speak speak speak sicinius you are at point to lose your liberties marcius would have all from you marcius whom late you have named for consul menenius fie fie fie this is the way to kindle not to quench first senator to unbuild the city and to lay all flat sicinius what is the city but the people citizens true the people are the city brutus by the consent of all we were establishd the peoples magistrates citizens you so remain menenius and so are like to do cominius that is the way to lay the city flat to bring the roof to the foundation and bury all which yet distinctly ranges in heaps and piles of ruin sicinius this deserves death brutus or let us stand to our authority or let us lose it we do here pronounce upon the part o the people in whose power we were elected theirs marcius is worthy of present death sicinius therefore lay hold of him bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence into destruction cast him brutus aediles seize him citizens yield marcius yield menenius hear me one word beseech you tribunes hear me but a word aedile peace peace menenius brutus sir those cold ways that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous where the disease is violent lay hands upon him and bear him to the rock coriolanus no ill die here theres some among you have beheld me fighting come try upon yourselves what you have seen me menenius down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile brutus lay hands upon him cominius help marcius help you that be noble help him young and old citizens down with him down with him menenius go get you to your house be gone away all will be naught else second senator get you gone cominius stand fast we have as many friends as enemies menenius sham it be put to that first senator the gods forbid i prithee noble friend home to thy house leave us to cure this cause menenius for tis a sore upon us you cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you cominius come sir along with us coriolanus i would they were barbariansas they are though in rome litterdnot romansas they are not though calved i the porch o the capitol menenius be gone put not your worthy rage into your tongue one time will owe another coriolanus on fair ground i could beat forty of them cominius i could myself take up a brace o the best of them yea the two tribunes but now tis odds beyond arithmetic and manhood is calld foolery when it stands against a falling fabric will you hence before the tag return whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and oerbear what they are used to bear menenius pray you be gone ill try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patchd with cloth of any colour cominius nay come away a patrician this man has marrd his fortune menenius his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident or jove fors power to thunder his hearts his mouth what his breast forges that his tongue must vent and being angry does forget that ever he heard the name of death heres goodly work second patrician i would they were abed menenius i would they were in tiber what the vengeance could he not speak em fair sicinius where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself menenius you worthy tribunes sicinius he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought first citizen he shall well know the noble tribunes are the peoples mouths and we their hands citizens he shall sure ont menenius sir sir sicinius peace menenius do not cry havoc where you should but hunt with modest warrant sicinius sir how comest that you have holp to make this rescue menenius hear me speak as i do know the consuls worthiness so can i name his faults sicinius consul what consul menenius the consul coriolanus brutus he consul citizens no no no no no menenius if by the tribunes leave and yours good people i may be heard i would crave a word or two the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time sicinius speak briefly then for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies tonight menenius now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enrolld in joves own book like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own sicinius hes a disease that must be cut away menenius o hes a limb that has but a disease mortal to cut it off to cure it easy what has he done to rome thats worthy death killing our enemies the blood he hath lost which i dare vouch is more than that he hath by many an ouncehe droppd it for his country and what is left to lose it by his country were to us all that dot and suffer it a brand to the end o the world sicinius this is clean kam brutus merely awry when he did love his country it honourd him menenius the service of the foot being once gangrened is not then respected for what before it was brutus well hear no more pursue him to his house and pluck him thence lest his infection being of catching nature spread further menenius one word more one word this tigerfooted rage when it shall find the harm of unscannd swiftness will too late tie leaden pounds tos heels proceed by process lest parties as he is beloved break out and sack great rome with romans brutus if it were so sicinius what do ye talk have we not had a taste of his obedience our aediles smote ourselves resisted come menenius consider this he has been bred i the wars since he could draw a sword and is ill schoold in bolted language meal and bran together he throws without distinction give me leave ill go to him and undertake to bring him where he shall answer by a lawful form in peace to his utmost peril first senator noble tribunes it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody and the end of it unknown to the beginning sicinius noble menenius be you then as the peoples officer masters lay down your weapons brutus go not home sicinius meet on the marketplace well attend you there where if you bring not marcius well proceed in our first way menenius ill bring him to you let me desire your company he must come or what is worst will follow first senator pray you lets to him coriolanus let them puff all about mine ears present me death on the wheel or at wild horses heels or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight yet will i still be thus to them a patrician you do the nobler coriolanus i muse my mother does not approve me further who was wont to call them woollen vassals things created to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads in congregations to yawn be still and wonder when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war i talk of you why did you wish me milder would you have me false to my nature rather say i play the man i am volumnia o sir sir sir i would have had you put your power well on before you had worn it out coriolanus let go volumnia you might have been enough the man you are with striving less to be so lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions if you had not showd them how ye were disposed ere they lackd power to cross you coriolanus let them hang a patrician ay and burn too menenius come come you have been too rough something too rough you must return and mend it first senator theres no remedy unless by not so doing our good city cleave in the midst and perish volumnia pray be counselld i have a heart as little apt as yours but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage menenius well said noble woman before he should thus stoop to the herd but that the violent fit o the time craves it as physic for the whole state i would put mine armour on which i can scarcely bear coriolanus what must i do menenius return to the tribunes coriolanus well what then what then menenius repent what you have spoke coriolanus for them i cannot do it to the gods must i then dot to them volumnia you are too absolute though therein you can never be too noble but when extremities speak i have heard you say honour and policy like unseverd friends i the war do grow together grant that and tell me in peace what each of them by the other lose that they combine not there coriolanus tush tush menenius a good demand volumnia if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not which for your best ends you adopt your policy how is it less or worse that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour as in war since that to both it stands in like request coriolanus why force you this volumnia because that now it lies you on to speak to the people not by your own instruction nor by the matter which your heart prompts you but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosoms truth now this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour i am in this your wife your son these senators the nobles and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin menenius noble lady come go with us speak fair you may salve so not what is dangerous present but the loss of what is past volumnia i prithee now my son go to them with this bonnet in thy hand and thus far having stretchd ithere be with them thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the earswaving thy head which often thus correcting thy stout heart now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them thou art their soldier and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which thou dost confess were fit for thee to use as they to claim in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far as thou hast power and person menenius this but done even as she speaks why their hearts were yours for they have pardons being askd as free as words to little purpose volumnia prithee now go and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower here is cominius cominius i have been i the marketplace and sirtis fit you make strong party or defend yourself by calmness or by absence alls in anger menenius only fair speech cominius i think twill serve if he can thereto frame his spirit volumnia he must and will prithee now say you will and go about it coriolanus must i go show them my unbarbed sconce must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear well i will dot yet were there but this single plot to lose this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it and throwt against the wind to the marketplace you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life cominius come come well prompt you volumnia i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier so to have my praise for this perform a part thou hast not done before coriolanus well i must dot away my disposition and possess me some harlots spirit my throat of war be turnd which quired with my drum into a pipe small as an eunuch or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up the glasses of my sight a beggars tongue make motion through my lips and my armd knees who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his that hath received an alms i will not dot lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my bodys action teach my mind a most inherent baseness volumnia at thy choice then to beg of thee it is my more dishonour than thou of them come all to ruin let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death with as big heart as thou do as thou list thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me but owe thy pride thyself coriolanus pray be content mother i am going to the marketplace chide me no more ill mountebank their loves cog their hearts from them and come home beloved of all the trades in rome look i am going commend me to my wife ill return consul or never trust to what my tongue can do i the way of flattery further volumnia do your will cominius away the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly for they are prepared with accusations as i hear more strong than are upon you yet coriolanus the word is mildly pray you let us go let them accuse me by invention i will answer in mine honour menenius ay but mildly coriolanus well mildly be it then mildly brutus in this point charge him home that he affects tyrannical power if he evade us there enforce him with his envy to the people and that the spoil got on the antiates was neer distributed what will he come aedile hes coming brutus how accompanied aedile with old menenius and those senators that always favourd him sicinius have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll aedile i have tis ready sicinius have you collected them by tribes aedile i have sicinius assemble presently the people hither and when they bear me say it shall be so i the right and strength o the commons be it either for death for fine or banishment then let them if i say fine cry fine if death cry death insisting on the old prerogative and power i the truth o the cause aedile i shall inform them brutus and when such time they have begun to cry let them not cease but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence aedile very well sicinius make them be strong and ready for this hint when we shall hap to give t them brutus go about it put him to choler straight he hath been used ever to conquer and to have his worth of contradiction being once chafed he cannot be reind again to temperance then he speaks whats in his heart and that is there which looks with us to break his neck sicinius well here he comes menenius calmly i do beseech you coriolanus ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece will bear the knave by the volume the honourd gods keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice supplied with worthy men plant love among s throng our large temples with the shows of peace and not our streets with war first senator amen amen menenius a noble wish sicinius draw near ye people aedile list to your tribunes audience peace i say coriolanus first hear me speak both tribunes well say peace ho coriolanus shall i be charged no further than this present must all determine here sicinius i do demand if you submit you to the peoples voices allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you coriolanus i am content menenius lo citizens he says he is content the warlike service he has done consider think upon the wounds his body bears which show like graves i the holy churchyard coriolanus scratches with briers scars to move laughter only menenius consider further that when he speaks not like a citizen you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds but as i say such as become a soldier rather than envy you cominius well well no more coriolanus what is the matter that being passd for consul with full voice i am so dishonourd that the very hour you take it off again sicinius answer to us coriolanus say then tis true i ought so sicinius we charge you that you have contrived to take from rome all seasond office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical for which you are a traitor to the people coriolanus how traitor menenius nay temperately your promise coriolanus the fires i the lowest hell foldin the people call me their traitor thou injurious tribune within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths in thy hand clutchd as many millions in thy lying tongue both numbers i would say thou liest unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods sicinius mark you this people citizens to the rock to the rock with him sicinius peace we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak beating your officers cursing yourselves opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him even this so criminal and in such capital kind deserves the extremest death brutus but since he hath served well for rome coriolanus what do you prate of service brutus i talk of that that know it coriolanus you menenius is this the promise that you made your mother cominius know i pray you coriolanus i know no further let them

thourt troublesome second servingman are you so brave ill have you talked with anon third servingman what fellows this first servingman a strange one as ever i looked on i cannot get him out of the house prithee call my master to him third servingman what have you to do here fellow pray you avoid the house coriolanus let me but stand i will not hurt your hearth third servingman what are you coriolanus a gentleman third servingman a marvellous poor one coriolanus true so i am third servingman pray you poor gentleman take up some other station heres no place for you pray you avoid come coriolanus follow your function go and batten on cold bits third servingman what you will not prithee tell my master what a strange guest he has here second servingman and i shall third servingman where dwellest thou coriolanus under the canopy third servingman under the canopy coriolanus ay third servingman wheres that coriolanus i the city of kites and crows third servingman i the city of kites and crows what an ass it is then thou dwellest with daws too coriolanus no i serve not thy master third servingman how sir do you meddle with my master coriolanus ay tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress thou pratest and pratest serve with thy trencher hence aufidius where is this fellow second servingman here sir ild have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords within aufidius whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name why speakst not speak man whats thy name coriolanus if tullus not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not think me for the man i am necessity commands me name myself aufidius what is thy name coriolanus a name unmusical to the volscians ears and harsh in sound to thine aufidius say whats thy name thou hast a grim appearance and thy face bears a command int though thy tackles torn thou showst a noble vessel whats thy name coriolanus prepare thy brow to frown knowst thou me yet aufidius i know thee not thy name coriolanus my name is caius marcius who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief thereto witness may my surname coriolanus the painful service the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname a good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains the cruelty and envy of the people permitted by our dastard nobles who have all forsook me hath devourd the rest and sufferd me by the voice of slaves to be whoopd out of rome now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope mistake me notto save my life for if i had feard death of all the men i the world i would have voided thee but in mere spite to be full quit of those my banishers stand i before thee here then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee for i will fight against my cankerd country with the spleen of all the under fiends but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes thourt tired then in a word i also am longer to live most weary and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice which not to cut would show thee but a fool since i have ever followd thee with hate drawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breast and cannot live but to thy shame unless it be to do thee service aufidius o marcius marcius each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say tis true ild not believe them more than thee all noble marcius let me twine mine arms about that body where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarrd the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour know thou first i loved the maid i married never man sighd truer breath but that i see thee here thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee we have a power on foot and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out twelve several times and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me we have been down together in my sleep unbuckling helms fisting each others throat and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius had we no quarrel else to rome but that thou art thence banishd we would muster all from twelve to seventy and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome like a bold flood oerbear o come go in and take our friendly senators by the hands who now are here taking their leaves of me who am prepared against your territories though not for rome itself coriolanus you bless me gods aufidius therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges take the one half of my commission and set down as best thou art experienced since thou knowst thy countrys strength and weaknessthine own ways whether to knock against the gates of rome or rudely visit them in parts remote to fright them ere destroy but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes and more a friend than eer an enemy yet marcius that was much your hand most welcome first servingman heres a strange alteration second servingman by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him first servingman what an arm he has he turned me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top second servingman nay i knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methoughti cannot tell how to term it first servingman he had so looking as it werewould i were hanged but i thought there was more in him than i could think second servingman so did i ill be sworn he is simply the rarest man i the world first servingman i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on second servingman who my master first servingman nay its no matter for that second servingman worth six on him first servingman nay not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier second servingman faith look you one cannot tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent first servingman ay and for an assault too third servingman o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals first servingman what what what lets partake third servingman i would not be a roman of all nations i had as lieve be a condemned man first servingman wherefore wherefore third servingman why heres he that was wont to thwack our general caius marcius first servingman why do you say thwack our general third servingman i do not say thwack our general but he was always good enough for him second servingman come we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him i have heard him say so himself first servingman he was too hard for him directly to say the troth ont before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado second servingman an he had been cannibally given he might have broiled and eaten him too first servingman but more of thy news third servingman why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself withs hand and turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table hell go he says and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled second servingman and hes as like to dot as any man i can imagine third servingman dot he will dot for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not look you sir show themselves as we term it his friends whilst hes in directitude first servingman directitude whats that third servingman but when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel all with him first servingman but when goes this forward third servingman tomorrow today presently you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon tis as it were a parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips second servingman why then we shall have a stirring world again this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed balladmakers first servingman let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as day does night its spritely waking audible and full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than wars a destroyer of men second servingman tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds first servingman ay and it makes men hate one another third servingman reason because they then less need one another the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians they are rising they are rising all in in in in sicinius we hear not of him neither need we fear him his remedies are tame i the present peace and quietness of the people which before were in wild hurry here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well who rather had though they themselves did suffer byt behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly brutus we stood tot in good time is this menenius sicinius tis hetis he o he is grown most kind of late both tribunes hail sir menenius hail to you both sicinius your coriolanus is not much missd but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand and so would do were he more angry at it menenius alls well and might have been much better if he could have temporized sicinius where is he hear you menenius nay i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him citizens the gods preserve you both sicinius godden our neighbours brutus godden to you all godden to you all first citizen ourselves our wives and children on our knees are bound to pray for you both sicinius live and thrive brutus farewell kind neighbours we wishd coriolanus had loved you as we did citizens now the gods keep you both tribunes farewell farewell sicinius this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets crying confusion brutus caius marcius was a worthy officer i the war but insolent oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking selfloving sicinius and affecting one sole throne without assistance menenius i think not so sicinius we should by this to all our lamentation if he had gone forth consul found it so brutus the gods have well prevented it and rome sits safe and still without him aedile worthy tribunes there is a slave whom we have put in prison reports the volsces with two several powers are enterd in the roman territories and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before em menenius tis aufidius who hearing of our marcius banishment thrusts forth his horns again into the world which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome and durst not once peep out sicinius come what talk you of marcius brutus go see this rumourer whippd it cannot be the volsces dare break with us menenius cannot be we have record that very well it can and three examples of the like have been within my age but reason with the fellow before you punish him where he heard this lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded sicinius tell not me i know this cannot be brutus not possible messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the senatehouse some news is come that turns their countenances sicinius tis this slave go whip him fore the peoples eyeshis raising nothing but his report messenger yes worthy sir the slaves report is seconded and more more fearful is deliverd sicinius what more fearful messenger it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not knowthat marcius joind with aufidius leads a power gainst rome and vows revenge as spacious as between the youngst and oldest thing sicinius this is most likely brutus raised only that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again sicinius the very trick ont menenius this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army led by caius marcius associated with aufidius rages upon our territories and have already oerborne their way consumed with fire and took what lay before them cominius o you have made good work menenius what news what news cominius you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates to see your wives dishonourd to your noses menenius whats the news whats the news cominius your temples burned in their cement and your franchises whereon you stood confined into an augers bore menenius pray now your news you have made fair work i fear mepray your news if marcius should be joind with volscians cominius if he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature that shapes man better and they follow him against us brats with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies or butchers killing flies menenius you have made good work you and your apronmen you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of garliceaters cominius he will shake your rome about your ears menenius as hercules did shake down mellow fruit you have made fair work brutus but is this true sir cominius ay and youll look pale before you find it other all the regions do smilingly revolt and who resist are mockd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools who ist can blame him your enemies and his find something in him menenius we are all undone unless the noble man have mercy cominius who shall ask it the tribunes cannot dot for shame the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends if they should say be good to rome they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate and therein showd like enemies menenius tis true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it i have not the face to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands you and your crafts you have crafted fair cominius you have brought a trembling upon rome such as was never so incapable of help both tribunes say not we brought it menenius how was it we we loved him but like beasts and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters who did hoot him out o the city cominius but i fear theyll roar him in again tullus aufidius the second name of men obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy strength and defence that rome can make against them menenius here come the clusters and is aufidius with him you are they that made the air unwholesome when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus exile now hes coming and not a hair upon a soldiers head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down and pay you for your voices tis no matter if he could burn us all into one coal we have deserved it citizens faith we hear fearful news first citizen for mine own part when i said banish him i said twas pity second citizen and so did i third citizen and so did i and to say the truth so did very many of us that we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will cominius ye re goodly things you voices menenius you have made good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol cominius o ay what else sicinius go masters get you home be not dismayd these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear go home and show no sign of fear first citizen the gods be good to us come masters lets home i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished him second citizen so did we all but come lets home brutus i do not like this news sicinius nor i brutus lets to the capitol would half my wealth would buy this for a lie sicinius pray let us go aufidius do they still fly to the roman lieutenant i do not know what witchcrafts in him but your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat their talk at table and their thanks at end and you are darkend in this action sir even by your own aufidius i cannot help it now unless by using means i lame the foot of our design he bears himself more proudlier even to my person than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in thats no changeling and i must excuse what cannot be amended lieutenant yet i wish sir i mean for your particularyou had not joind in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself or else to him had left it solely aufidius i understand thee well and be thou sure when he shall come to his account he knows not what i can urge against him although it seems and so he thinks and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly and shows good husbandry for the volscian state fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon as draw his sword yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine wheneer we come to our account lieutenant sir i beseech you think you hell carry rome aufidius all places yield to him ere he sits down and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence i think hell be to rome as is the osprey to the fish who takes it by sovereignty of nature first he was a noble servant to them but he could not carry his honours even whether twas pride which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man whether defect of judgment to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of or whether nature not to be other than one thing not moving from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controlld the war but one of these as he hath spices of them all not all for i dare so far free himmade him feard so hated and so banishd but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power unto itself most commendable hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail come lets away when caius rome is thine thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine menenius no ill not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general who loved him in a most dear particular he calld me father but what o that go you that banishd him a mile before his tent fall down and knee the way into his mercy nay if he coyd to hear cominius speak ill keep at home cominius he would not seem to know me menenius do you hear cominius yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance and the drops that we have bled together coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names he was a kind of nothing titleless till he had forged himself a name o the fire of burning rome menenius why so you have made good work a pair of tribunes that have rackd for rome to make coals cheapa noble memory cominius i minded him how royal twas to pardon when it was less expected he replied it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punishd menenius very well could he say less cominius i offerd to awaken his regard fors private friends his answer to me was he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said twas folly for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt and still to nose the offence menenius for one poor grain or two i am one of those his mother wife his child and this brave fellow too we are the grains you are the musty chaff and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you sicinius nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid in this so neverneeded help yet do not upbraids with our distress but sure if you would be your countrys pleader your good tongue more than the instant army we can make might stop our countryman menenius no ill not meddle sicinius pray you go to him menenius what should i do brutus only make trial what your love can do for rome towards marcius menenius well and say that marcius return me as cominius is returnd unheard what then but as a discontented friend griefshot with his unkindness sayt be so sicinius yet your good will must have that thanks from rome after the measure as you intended well menenius ill undertake t i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffd these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore ill watch him till he be dieted to my request and then ill set upon him brutus you know the very road into his kindness and cannot lose your way menenius good faith ill prove him speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge of my success cominius hell never hear him sicinius not cominius i tell you he does sit in gold his eye red as twould burn rome and his injury the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him twas very faintly he said rise dismissd me thus with his speechless hand what he would do he sent in writing after me what he would not bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain unless his noble mother and his wife who as i hear mean to solicit him for mercy to his country therefore lets hence and with our fair entreaties haste them on first senator stay whence are you second senator stand and go back menenius you guard like men tis well but by your leave i am an officer of state and come to speak with coriolanus first senator from whence menenius from rome first senator you may not pass you must return our general will no more hear from thence second senator youll see your rome embraced with fire before youll speak with coriolanus menenius good my friends if you have heard your general talk of rome and of his friends there it is lots to blanks my name hath touchd your ears it is menenius first senator be it so go back the virtue of your name is not here passable menenius i tell thee fellow the general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts whence men have read his name unparalleld haply amplified for i have ever verified my friends of whom hes chief with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay sometimes like to a bowl upon a subtle ground i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise have almost stampd the leasing therefore fellow i must have leave to pass first senator faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely therefore go back menenius prithee fellow remember my name is menenius always factionary on the party of your general second senator howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have i am one that telling true under him must say you cannot pass therefore go back menenius has he dined canst thou tell for i would not speak with him till after dinner first senator you are a roman are you menenius i am as thy general is first senator then you should hate rome as he does can you when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this no you are deceived therefore back to rome and prepare for your execution you are condemned our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon menenius sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would use me with estimation second senator come my captain knows you not menenius i mean thy general first senator my general cares not for you back i say go lest i let forth your halfpint of blood backthats the utmost of your having back menenius nay but fellow fellow coriolanus whats the matter menenius now you companion ill say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from

unproperly show duty as mistaken all this while between the child and parent coriolanus what is this your knees to me to your corrected son then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars

of yours which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself coriolanus the god of soldiers with the consent of supreme jove inform thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove to

soldiers or capitulate again with romes mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not to ally my rages and revenges with your colder reasons volumnia o no more no more you have said you will not grant us any thing for we have nothing else to ask but that which you deny already yet we will ask that if you fail in our request the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us coriolanus aufidius and you volsces mark for well hear nought from rome in private your request volumnia should we be silent and not speak our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight which should make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow making the mother wife and child to see the son the husband and the father tearing his countrys bowels out and to poor we thine enmitys most capital thou barrst us our prayers to the gods which is a comfort that all but we enjoy for how can we alas how can we for our country pray whereto we are bound together with thy victory whereto we are bound alack or we must lose the country our dear nurse or else thy person our comfort in the country we must find an evident calamity though we had our wish which side should win for either thou must as a foreign recreant be led with manacles thorough our streets or else triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and childrens blood for myself son i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i cannot persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread trust tot thou shalt noton thy mothers womb that brought thee to this world virgilia ay and mine that brought you forth this boy to keep your name living to time young marcius a shall not tread on me ill run away till i am bigger but then ill fight coriolanus not of a womans tenderness to be requires nor child nor womans face to see i have sat too long volumnia nay go not from us thus if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us as poisonous of your honour no our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say this mercy we have showd the romans this we received and each in either side give the allhail to thee and cry be blest for making up this peace thou knowst great son the end of wars uncertain but this certain that if thou conquer rome the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition will be doggd with curses whose chronicle thus writ the man was noble but with his last attempt he wiped it out destroyd his country and his name remains to the ensuing age abhorrd speak to me son thou hast affected the fine strains of honour to imitate the graces of the gods to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak why dost not speak thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs daughter speak you he cares not for your weeping speak thou boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons theres no man in the world more bound to s mother yet

with honour say my requests unjust and spurn me back but if it be not so thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee that thou restrainst from me the duty which to a mothers part belongs he turns away down ladies let us shame him with our knees to his surname coriolanus longs more pride than pity to our prayers down an end this is the last so we will home to rome and die among our neighbours nay behold s this boy that cannot tell what he would have but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny t come let us go

made for alexander what he bids be done is finished with his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in sicinius yes mercy if you report him truly menenius i paint him in the character mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you sicinius the

deliver you of your great danger aufidius sir i cannot tell we must proceed as we do find the people third conspirator the people will remain uncertain whilst twixt you theres difference but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all aufidius i know it and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction i raised him and i pawnd mine honour for his truth who being so heightend he waterd his new plants with dews of flattery seducing so my friends and to this end he bowd his nature never known before but to be rough unswayable and free third conspirator sir his stoutness when he did stand for consul which he lost by lack of stooping aufidius that i would have spoke of being banishd fort he came unto my hearth presented to my knife his throat i took him made him jointservant with me gave him way in all his own desires nay let him choose out of my files his projects to accomplish my best and freshest men served his designments in mine own person holp to reap the fame which he did end all his and took some pride to do myself this wrong till at the last i seemd his follower not partner and he waged me with his countenance as if i had been mercenary first conspirator so he did my lord the army marvelld at it and in the last when he had carried rome and that we lookd for no less spoil than glory aufidius there was it for which my sinews shall be stretchd upon him at a few drops of womens rheum which are as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die and ill renew me in his fall but hark first conspirator your native town you enterd like a post and had no welcomes home but he returns splitting the air with noise second conspirator and patient fools whose children he hath slain their base throats tear with giving him glory third conspirator therefore at your vantage ere he express himself or move the people with what he would say let him feel your sword which we will second when he lies along after your way his tale pronounced shall bury his reasons with his body aufidius say no more here come the lords all the lords you are most welcome home aufidius i have not deserved it but worthy lords have you with heed perused what i have written to you lords we have first lord and grieve to heart what faults he made before the last i think might have found easy fines but there to end where he was to begin and

am returnd your soldier no more infected with my countrys love than when i parted hence but still subsisting under your great command you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home do more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to the romans and we here deliver subscribed by the consuls and patricians together with the seal o the senate what we have compounded on aufidius read it not noble lords but tell

stain all your edges on me boy false hound if you have writ your annals true tis there that like an eagle in a dovecote i flutterd your volscians in corioli alone i did it boy aufidius why noble lords will you be put in mind of his blind fortune which was your shame by this unholy braggart fore your own eyes and ears all conspirators let him die fort all the people tear him to pieces do it

rage is gone and i am struck with sorrow take him up help three o the chiefest soldiers ill be one beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully trail your steel pikes though in this city he hath widowd and unchilded many a one which to this hour bewail the injury yet he shall have a noble memory assist gloucester now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lourd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass i that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph i that am curtaild of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformed unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair wellspoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewd up about a prophecy which says that g of edwards heirs the murderer shall be dive thoughts down to my soul here clarence comes brother good day what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace clarence his majesty tendering my persons safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower gloucester upon what cause clarence because my name is george gloucester alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers o belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be newchristend in the tower but whats the matter clarence may i know clarence yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the crossrow plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he these as i learn and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now gloucester why this it is when men are ruled by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity was it not she and that good man of worship anthony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is deliverd we are not safe clarence we are not safe clarence by heaven i think theres no man is secure but the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery gloucester humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty ill tell you what i think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous oerworn widow and herself since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in this monarchy brakenbury i beseech your graces both to pardon me his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference of what degree soever with his brother gloucester even so ant please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shores wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks how say you sir can you deny all this brakenbury with this my lord myself have nought to do gloucester naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best he do it secretly alone brakenbury what one my lord gloucester her husband knave wouldst thou betray me brakenbury i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke clarence we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey gloucester we are the queens abjects and must obey brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoever you will employ me in were it to call king edwards widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine clarence i know it pleaseth neither of us well gloucester well your imprisonment shall not be long meantime have patience clarence i must perforce farewell gloucester go tread the path that thou shalt neer return simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands but who comes here the newdeliverd hastings hastings good time of day unto my gracious lord gloucester as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air how hath your lordship brookd imprisonment hastings with patience noble lord as prisoners must but i shall live my lord to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment gloucester no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevaild as much on him as you hastings more pity that the eagle should be mewd while kites and buzzards prey at liberty gloucester what news abroad hastings no news so bad abroad as this at home the king is sickly weak and melancholy and his physicians fear him mightily gloucester now by saint paul this news is bad indeed o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumed his royal person tis very grievous to be thought upon what is he in his bed hastings he is gloucester go you before and i will follow you he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be packd with posthorse up to heaven ill in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeld with weighty arguments and if i fall not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then ill marry warwicks youngest daughter what though i killd her husband and her father the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i not all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains lady anne set down set down your honourable load if honour may be shrouded in a hearse whilst i awhile obsequiously lament the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster poor keycold figure of a holy king pale ashes of the house of lancaster thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost to hear the lamentations of poor anne wife to thy edward to thy slaughterd son stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds lo in these windows that let forth thy life i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it cursed the blood that let this blood from hence more direful hap betide that hated wretch that makes us wretched by the death of thee than i can wish to adders spiders toads or any creeping venomd thing that lives if ever he have child abortive be it prodigious and untimely brought to light whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view and that be heir to his unhappiness if ever he have wife let her he made a miserable by the death of him as i am made by my poor lord and thee come now towards chertsey with your holy load taken from pauls to be interred there and still as you are weary of the weight rest you whiles i lament king henrys corse gloucester stay you that bear the corse and set it down lady anne what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds gloucester villains set down the corse or by saint paul ill make a corse of him that disobeys gentleman my lord stand back and let the coffin pass gloucester unmannerd dog stand thou when i command advance thy halbert higher than my breast or by saint paul ill strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness lady anne what do you tremble are you all afraid alas i blame you not for you are mortal and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell thou hadst but power over his mortal body his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone gloucester sweet saint for charity be not so curst lady anne foul devil for gods sake hence and trouble us not for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds behold this pattern of thy butcheries o gentlemen see see dead henrys wounds open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh blush blush thou lump of foul deformity for tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells thy deed inhuman and unnatural provokes this deluge most unnatural o god which this blood madest revenge his death o earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead or earth gape open wide and eat him quick as thou dost swallow up this good kings blood which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered gloucester lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses lady anne villain thou knowst no law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity gloucester but i know none and therefore am no beast lady anne o wonderful when devils tell the truth gloucester more wonderful when angels are so angry vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposedevils to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself lady anne vouchsafe defused infection of a man for these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to curse thy cursed self gloucester fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself lady anne fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself gloucester by such despair i should accuse myself lady anne and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself which didst unworthy slaughter upon others gloucester say that i slew them not lady anne why then they are not dead but dead they are and devilish slave by thee gloucester i did not kill your husband lady anne why then he is alive gloucester nay he is dead and slain by edwards hand lady anne in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood the which thou once didst bend against her breast but that thy brothers beat aside the point gloucester i was provoked by her slanderous tongue which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders lady anne thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind which never dreamt on aught but butcheries didst thou not kill this king gloucester i grant ye lady anne dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed o he was gentle mild and virtuous gloucester the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him lady anne he is in heaven where thou shalt never come gloucester let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth lady anne and thou unfit for any place but hell gloucester yes one place else if you will hear me name it lady anne some dungeon gloucester your bedchamber lady anne ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest gloucester so will it madam till i lie with you lady anne i hope so gloucester i know so but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall somewhat into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner lady anne thou art the cause and most accursed effect gloucester your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom lady anne if i thought that i tell thee homicide these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks gloucester these eyes could never endure sweet beautys wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life lady anne black night oershade thy day and death thy life gloucester curse not thyself fair creature thou art both lady anne i would i were to be revenged on thee gloucester it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revenged on him that loveth you lady anne it is a quarrel just and reasonable to be revenged on him that slew my husband gloucester he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband lady anne his better doth not breathe upon the earth gloucester he lives that loves thee better than he could lady anne name him gloucester plantagenet lady anne why that was he gloucester the selfsame name but one of better nature lady anne where is he gloucester here why dost thou spit at me lady anne would it were mortal poison for thy sake gloucester never came poison from so sweet a place lady anne never hung poison on a fouler toad out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes gloucester thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine lady anne would they were basilisks to strike thee dead gloucester i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamed their aspect with store of childish drops these eyes that never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my fathers death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standersby had wet their cheeks like trees bedashd with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposed my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made for kissing lady not for such contempt if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true bosom and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but twas thy beauty that provoked me nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward but twas thy heavenly face that set me on take up the sword again or take up me lady anne arise dissembler though i wish thy death i will not be the executioner gloucester then bid me kill myself and i will do it lady anne i have already gloucester tush that was in thy rage speak it again and even with the word that hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary lady anne i would i knew thy heart gloucester tis figured in my tongue lady anne i fear me both are false gloucester then never man was true lady anne well well put up your sword gloucester say then my peace is made lady

believe it and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers vaughan grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil but soft here come my executioners how now my hardy stout resolved mates are you now going to dispatch this deed first murderer we are my lord and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is gloucester well thought upon i have it here about me when you have done repair to crosby place but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him first murderer tush fear not my lord we will not stand

go go dispatch first murderer we will my noble lord brakenbury why looks your grace so heavily today clarence o i have passd a miserable night so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time brakenbury what was your dream i long to hear you tell it clarence methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embarkd to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england and cited up a thousand fearful times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befalln us as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main lord lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears what ugly sights of death within mine eyes methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scatterd in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems which wood the slimy bottom of the deep and mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by brakenbury had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep clarence methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood kept in my soul and would not let it forth to seek the empty vast and wandering air but smotherd it within my panting bulk which almost burst to belch it in the sea brakenbury awaked you not with this sore agony clarence o no my dream was lengthend after life o then began the tempest to my soul who passd methought the melancholy flood with that grim ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick who cried aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanishd then came wandering by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him to your torments with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environd me about and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling waked and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made the dream brakenbury no marvel my lord though it affrighted you i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it clarence o brakenbury i have done those things which now bear evidence against my soul for edwards sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep brakenbury i will my lord god give your grace good rest sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide night princes have but their tides for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imagination they often feel a world of restless cares so that betwixt their tides and low names theres nothing differs but the outward fame first murderer ho whos here brakenbury in gods name what are you and how came you hither first murderer i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs brakenbury yea are you so brief second murderer o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show him our commission talk no more brakenbury i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands i will not reason what is meant hereby because i will be guiltless of the meaning here are the keys there sits the duke asleep ill to the king and signify to him that thus i have resignd my charge to you first murderer do so it is a point of wisdom fare you well second murderer what shall we stab him as he sleeps first murderer no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes second murderer when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till the judgmentday first murderer why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping second murderer the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me first murderer what art thou afraid second murderer not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us first murderer i thought thou hadst been resolute second murderer so i am to let him live first murderer back to the duke of gloucester tell him so second murderer i pray thee stay a while i hope my holy humour will change twas wont to hold me but while one would tell twenty first murderer how dost thou feel thyself now second murderer faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me first murderer remember our reward when the deed is done second murderer zounds he dies i had forgot the reward first murderer where is thy conscience now second murderer in the duke of gloucesters purse first murderer so when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out second murderer let it go theres few or none will entertain it first murderer how if it come to thee again second murderer ill not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it makes a man a coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him he cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it detects him tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that i found it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it first murderer zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke second murderer take the devil in thy mind and relieve him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh first murderer tut i am strongframed he cannot prevail with me i warrant thee second murderer spoke like a tail fellow that respects his reputation come shall we to this gear first murderer take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt in the next room second murderer o excellent devise make a sop of him first murderer hark he stirs shall i strike second murderer no first lets reason with him clarence where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine second murderer you shall have wine enough my lord anon clarence in gods name what art thou second murderer a man as you are clarence but not as i am royal second murderer

do menace me why look you pale who sent you hither wherefore do you come both to to to clarence to murder me both ay ay clarence you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it wherein my friends have i offended you first murderer offended us you have not but the king clarence i shall be reconciled to him again second murderer never my lord therefore prepare to die clarence are you calld forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent what is my offence where are the evidence that do accuse me what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence death before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable first murderer what we will do we do upon command second murderer and he that hath commanded is the king clarence erroneous vassal the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou then spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands to hurl upon their heads that break his law second murderer and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the holy sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster first murderer and like a traitor to the name of god didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade unripdst the bowels of thy sovereigns son second murderer whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend first murderer how canst thou urge gods dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in so dear degree clarence alas for whose sake did i that ill deed for edward for my brother for his sake why sirs he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i if god will be revenged for this deed o know you yet he doth it publicly take not the quarrel from his powerful arm he needs no indirect nor lawless course to cut off those that have offended him first murderer who made thee then a bloody minister when gallantspringing brave plantagenet that princely novice was struck dead by thee clarence my brothers love the devil and my rage first murderer thy brothers love our duty and thy fault provoke us hither now to slaughter thee clarence oh if you love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well if you be hired for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death second murderer you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you clarence o no he loves me and he holds me dear go you to him from me both ay so we will clarence tell him when that our princely father york blessd his three sons with his victorious arm and charged us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship bid gloucester think of this and he will weep first murderer ay millstones as be lessond us to weep clarence o do not slander him for he is kind first murderer right as snow in harvest thou deceivest thyself tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee clarence it cannot be for when i parted with him he huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labour my delivery second murderer why so he doth now he delivers thee from this worlds thraldom to the joys of heaven first murderer make peace with god for you must die my lord clarence hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul to counsel me to make my peace with god and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind that thou wilt war with god by murdering me ah sirs consider he that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed second murderer what shall we do clarence relent and save your souls first murderer relent tis cowardly and womanish clarence not to relent is beastly savage devilish which of you if you were a princes son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities not second murderer look behind you my lord first murderer take that and that if all this will not do ill drown you in the malmseybutt within second murderer a bloody deed and desperately dispatchd how fain like pilate would i wash my hands of this most grievous guilty murder done first murderer how now what meanst thou that thou helpst me not by heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art second murderer i would he knew that i

princely brother presently if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce cardinal my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory can from his mother win the duke of york anon expect him here but if she be obdurate to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin buckingham you are too senselessobstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claimd it nor deserved it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children neer till now cardinal my lord you shall oerrule my mind

edward my lord protector needs will have it so york i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower gloucester why what should you fear york marry my uncle clarence angry ghost my grandam told me he was

sapling witherd up and this is edwards wife that monstrous witch consorted with that harlot strumpet shore that by their witchcraft thus have marked me hastings if they have done this thing my gracious lord gloucester if i thou protector of this damned strumpet tellest thou me of ifs thou art a traitor off with his head now by saint paul i swear i will not dine until i see the same lovel

his helm but i disdaind it and did scorn to fly three times today my footcloth horse did stumble and startled when he lookd upon the tower as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse o now i want the priest that spake to me i now repent i told the pursuivant as twere triumphing at mine enemies how they at pomfret bloodily were butcherd and i myself secure in grace and favour o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings wretched head ratcliff dispatch my lord the duke would be at dinner make a short shrift he longs to see your head hastings o momentary grace of mortal men which we more hunt for than the grace of god who builds his hopes in air of your good looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep lovel come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim hastings o bloody richard miserable england i prophesy the fearfulst time to thee that ever wretched age hath lookd upon come lead me to the block bear him my head they smile at me that shortly shall be dead gloucester come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in the middle of a word and then begin again and stop again as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror buckingham tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems but what is catesby gone gloucester he is and see he brings the mayor along buckingham lord mayor gloucester look to the drawbridge there buckingham hark a drum gloucester catesby oerlook the walls buckingham lord mayor the reason we have sent gloucester look back defend thee here are enemies buckingham god and our innocency defend and guard us gloucester be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel lovel here is the head of that ignoble traitor the dangerous and unsuspected hastings gloucester so dear i loved the man that i must weep i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shores wife he lived from all attainder of suspect buckingham well well he was the covertst shelterd traitor that ever lived would you imagine or almost believe weret not that by great preservation we live to tell it you the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the councilhouse to murder me and my good lord of gloucester lord mayor what had he so gloucester what think you we are turks or infidels or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly to the villains death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforced us to this execution lord mayor now fair befall you he deserved his death and you my good lords both have well proceeded to warn false traitors from the like attempts i never lookd for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore gloucester yet had not we determined he should die until your lordship came to see his death which now the loving haste of these our friends somewhat against our meaning have prevented because my lord we would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death lord mayor but my good lord your graces word shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak and doubt you not right noble princes both but ill acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this cause gloucester and to that end we wishd your lordship here to avoid the carping censures of the world buckingham but since you come too late of our intents yet witness what you hear we did intend and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell gloucester go after after cousin buckingham the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there at your meetst advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edwards children tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown meaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretched to their servants daughters wives even where his lustful eye or savage heart without control listed to make his prey nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by just computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly as twere far off because you know my lord my mother lives buckingham fear not my lord ill play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu gloucester if you thrive well bring them to baynards castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops buckingham i go and towards three or four oclock look for the news that the guildhall affords gloucester go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw go thou to friar penker bid them both meet me within this hour at baynards castle now will i in to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give notice that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes scrivener this is the indictment of the good lord hastings which in a set hand fairly is engrossd that it may be this day read over in pauls and mark how well the sequel hangs together eleven hours i spent to write it over for yesternight by catesby was it brought me the precedent was full as long adoing and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings untainted unexamined free at liberty heres a good world the while why whos so gross that seeth not this palpable device yet whos so blind but says he sees it not bad is the world and all will come to nought when such bad dealings must be seen in thought gloucester how now my lord what say the citizens buckingham now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum and speak not a word gloucester touchd you the bastardy of edwards children buckingham i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france the insatiate greediness of his desires and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your dicipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose untouchd or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory grew to an end i bid them that did love their countrys good cry god save richard englands royal king gloucester ah and did they so buckingham no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones gazed each on other and lookd deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and askd the mayor what meant this wilful silence his answer was the people were not wont to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urged to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd but nothing spake in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at the lower end of the hall hurld up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and loving shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard and even here brake off and came away gloucester what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak buckingham no by my troth my lord gloucester will not the mayor then and his brethren come buckingham the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayerbook in your hand and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord for on that ground ill build a holy descant and be not easily won to our request play the maids part still answer nay and take it gloucester i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt well bring it to a happy issue buckingham go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks welcome my lord i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal here comes his servant how now catesby what says he catesby my lord he doth entreat your grace to visit him tomorrow or next day he is within with two right reverend fathers divinely bent to meditation and no worldly suit would he be moved to draw him from his holy exercise buckingham return good catesby to thy lord again tell him myself the mayor and citizens in deep designs and matters of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace catesby ill tell him what you say my lord buckingham ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd daybed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this gracious prince take on himself the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall neer win him to it lord mayor marry god forbid his grace should say us nay buckingham i fear he will how now catesby what says your lord catesby my lord he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him his grace not being warnd thereof before my lord he fears you mean no good to him buckingham sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven i come in perfect love to him and so once more return and tell his grace when holy and devout religious men are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation lord mayor see where he stands between two clergymen buckingham two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ears to our request and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal gloucester my lord there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me who earnest in the service of my god neglect the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your graces pleasure buckingham even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovernd isle gloucester i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the citys eyes and that you come to reprehend my ignorance buckingham you have my lord would it might please your grace at our entreaties to amend that fault gloucester else wherefore breathe i in a christian land buckingham then know it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the scepterd office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemished stock whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our countrys good this noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defaced with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shoulderd in the swallowing gulf of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for anothers gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just suit come i to move your grace gloucester i know not whether to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tonguetied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasond with your faithful love to me then on the other side i chequed my friends therefore to speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects as i had rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smotherd but god be thankd theres no need of me and much i need to help you if need were the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay what you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him buckingham my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered you say that edward is your brothers son so say we too but not by edwards wife for first he was contract to lady lucy your mother lives a witness to that vow and afterward by substitute betrothd to bona sister to the king of france these both put by a poor petitioner a carecrazed mother of a many children a beautywaning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his lustful eye seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts to base declension and loathed bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners term the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this profferd benefit of dignity if non to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal truederived course lord mayor do good my lord your citizens entreat you buckingham refuse not mighty lord this profferd love catesby o make them joyful grant their lawful suit gloucester alas why would you heap these cares on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you buckingham if you refuse itas in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brothers son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kin and egally indeed to all estates yet whether you accept our suit or no your brothers son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you come citizens zounds ill entreat no more gloucester o do not swear my lord of buckingham catesby call them again my lord and accept their suit another do good my lord lest all the land do rue it gloucester would you enforce me to a world of care well call them again i am not made of stone but penetrable to your kind entreats albeit against my conscience and my soul cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burthen whether i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god he knows and you may partly see how far i am from the desire thereof lord mayor god bless your grace we see it and will say it gloucester in saying so you shall but say the truth buckingham then i salute you with this kingly title

suborn to do this ruthless piece of butchery although they were fleshd villains bloody dogs melting with tenderness and kind compassion wept like two children in their deaths sad stories lo thus quoth dighton lay those tender babes thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another within their innocent alabaster arms their lips were four red roses on a stalk which in their summer beauty kissd each other a book of prayers on their pillow lay which once quoth forrest almost changed my mind but o the devilthere the villain stoppd whilst dighton thus told on we smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature that from the prime creation eer she framed thus both are gone with conscience and remorse they could not speak and so i left them both to bring this tidings to the bloody king and here he

this king richard iii say that i did all this for love of her queen elizabeth nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil king richard iii look what is done cannot be now amended men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes which after hours give leisure to repent if i did take the kingdom from your sons to make amends ill give it to your daughter if i have killd the issue of your womb to quicken your increase i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter a grandams name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother they are as

richmond cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen that you have taen a tardy sluggard here lords how have you slept my lord richmond the sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams that ever enterd in a drowsy head have i since your departure had my lords methought their souls whose bodies richard murderd came to my tent and cried on victory i promise you my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream how far into the morning is it lords lords upon the stroke of four richmond why then tis time to arm and give direction more than i have said loving countrymen the leisure and enforcement of the time forbids to dwell upon yet remember this god and our good cause fight upon our side the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls like highreard bulwarks stand before our faces richard except those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow for what is he they follow truly gentlemen a bloody tyrant and a homicide one raised in blood and one in blood establishd one that made means to come by what he hath and slaughterd those that were the means to help him abase foul stone made precious by the foil of englands chair where he is falsely set one that hath ever been gods enemy then if you fight against gods enemy god will in justice ward you as his soldiers if you do sweat to put a tyrant down you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain if you do fight against your countrys foes your countrys fat shall pay your pains the hire if you do fight in safeguard of your wives your wives shall welcome home the conquerors if you do free your children from the sword your childrens children quit it in your age then in the name of god and all these rights advance your standards draw your willing swords for me the ransom of my bold attempt shall be this cold corpse on the earths cold face but if i thrive the gain of my attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully god and saint george

slaughterd his own son the son compelld been butcher to the sire all this divided york and lancaster divided in their dire division o now let richmond and elizabeth the true succeeders of each royal house by gods fair ordinance conjoin together and let their heirs god if thy will be so enrich the time to come with smoothfaced peace with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days abate the edge of traitors gracious lord that would reduce these bloody days again and make poor england weep in streams of blood let them not live to taste this lands increase that would with treason wound this fair lands peace now civil wounds are stoppd peace lives again that she may long live here god say amen king richard ii old john of gaunt timehonourd lancaster hast thou according to thy oath and band brought hither henry hereford thy bold son here to make good the boisterous late appeal which then our leisure would not let us hear against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray john of gaunt i have my liege king richard ii tell me moreover hast thou sounded him if he appeal the duke on ancient malice or worthily as a good subject should on some known ground of treachery in him john of gaunt as near as i could sift him on that argument on some apparent danger seen in him aimd at your highness no inveterate malice king richard ii then call them to our presence face to face and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear the accuser and the accused freely speak highstomachd are they both and full of ire in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire henry bolingbroke many years of happy days befal my gracious sovereign my most loving liege thomas mowbray each day still better others happiness until the heavens envying earths good hap add an immortal title to your crown king richard ii we thank you both yet one but flatters us as well appeareth by the cause you come namely to appeal each other of high treason cousin of hereford what dost thou object against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray henry bolingbroke first heaven be the record to my speech in the devotion of a subjects love tendering the precious safety of my prince and free from other misbegotten hate come i appellant to this princely presence now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee and mark my greeting well for what i speak my body shall make good upon this earth or my divine soul answer it in heaven thou art a traitor and a miscreant too good to be so and too bad to live since the more fair and crystal is the sky the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly once more the more to aggravate the note with a foul traitors name stuff i thy throat and wish so please my sovereign ere i move what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove thomas mowbray let not my cold words here accuse my zeal tis not the trial of a womans war the bitter clamour of two eager tongues can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain the blood is hot that must be coold for this yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be hushd and nought at all to say first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and spurs to my free speech which else would post until it had returnd these terms of treason doubled down his throat setting aside his high bloods royalty and let him be no kinsman to my liege i do defy him and i spit at him call him a slanderous coward and a villain which to maintain i would allow him odds and meet him were i tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the alps or any other ground inhabitable where ever englishman durst set his foot mean time let this defend my loyalty by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie henry bolingbroke pale trembling coward there i throw my gage disclaiming here the kindred of the king and lay aside my high bloods royalty which fear not reverence makes thee to except if guilty dread have left thee so much strength as to take up mine honours pawn then stoop by that and all the rites of knighthood else will i make good against thee arm to arm what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise thomas mowbray i take it up and by that sword i swear which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder ill answer thee in any fair degree or chivalrous design of knightly trial and when i mount alive may i not light if i be traitor or unjustly fight king richard ii what doth our cousin lay to mowbrays charge it must be great that can inherit us so much as of a thought of ill in him henry bolingbroke look what i speak my life shall prove it true that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness soldiers the which he hath detaind for lewd employments like a false traitor and injurious villain besides i say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was surveyd by english eye that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good that he did plot the duke of gloucesters death suggest his soonbelieving adversaries and consequently like a traitor coward sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood like sacrificing abels cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth to me for justice and rough chastisement and by the glorious worth of my descent this arm shall do it or this life be spent king richard ii how high a pitch his resolution soars thomas of norfolk what sayst thou to this thomas mowbray o let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf till i have told this slander of his blood how god and good men hate so foul a liar king richard ii mowbray impartial are our eyes and ears were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir as he is but my fathers brothers son now by my sceptres awe i make a vow such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood should nothing privilege him nor partialize the unstooping firmness of my upright soul he is our subject mowbray so art thou free speech and fearless i to thee allow thomas mowbray then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart through the false passage of thy throat thou liest three parts of that receipt i had for calais disbursed i duly to his highness soldiers the other part reserved i by consent for that my sovereign liege was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account since last i went to france to fetch his queen now swallow down that lie for gloucesters death i slew him not but to my own disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case for you my noble lord of lancaster the honourable father to my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it and exactly beggd your graces pardon and i hope i had it this is my fault as for the rest appealld it issues from the rancour of a villain a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitors foot to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom in haste whereof most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day king richard ii wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me lets purge this choler without letting blood this we prescribe though no physician deep malice makes too deep incision forget forgive conclude and be agreed our doctors say this is no month to bleed good uncle let this end where it begun well calm the duke of norfolk you your son john of gaunt to be a makepeace shall become my age throw down my son the duke of norfolks gage king richard ii and norfolk throw down his john of gaunt when harry when obedience bids i should not bid again king richard ii norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot thomas mowbray myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot my life thou shalt command but not my shame the one my duty owes but my fair name despite of death that lives upon my grave to dark dishonours use thou shalt not have i am disgraced impeachd and baffled here pierced to the soul with slanders venomd spear the which no balm can cure but his heartblood which breathed this poison king richard ii rage must be withstood give me his gage lions make leopards tame thomas mowbray yea but not change his spots take but my shame and i resign my gage my dear dear lord the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation that away men are but gilded loam or painted clay a jewel in a tentimesbarrdup chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast mine honour is my life both grow in one take honour from me and my life is done then dear my liege mine honour let me try in that i live and for that will i die king richard ii cousin throw up your gage do you begin henry bolingbroke o god defend my soul from such deep sin shall i seem crestfalln in my fathers sight or with pale beggarfear impeach my height before this outdared dastard ere my tongue shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear the slavish motive of recanting fear and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace where shame doth harbour even in mowbrays face king richard ii we were not born to sue but to command which since we cannot do to make you friends be ready as your lives shall answer it at coventry upon saint lamberts day there shall your swords and lances arbitrate the swelling difference of your settled hate since we can not atone you we shall see justice design the victors chivalry lord marshal command our officers at arms be ready to direct these home alarms john of gaunt alas the part i had in woodstocks blood doth more solicit me than your exclaims to stir against the butchers of his life but since correction lieth in those hands which made the fault that we cannot correct put we our quarrel to the will of heaven who when they see the hours ripe on earth will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads duchess finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur hath love in thy old blood no living fire edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one were as seven vials of his sacred blood or seven fair branches springing from one root some of those seven are dried by natures course some of those branches by the destinies cut but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester one vial full of edwards sacred blood one flourishing branch of his most royal root is crackd and all the precious liquor spilt is hackd down and his summer leaves all faded by envys hand and murders bloody axe ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb that metal that selfmould that fashiond thee made him a man and though thou livest and breathest yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent in some large measure to thy fathers death in that thou seest thy

and their spears and both return back to their chairs again withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound while we return these dukes what we decree draw near and list what with our council we have done for that our kingdoms earth should not be soild with that dear blood which it hath fostered and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds ploughd up with neighbours sword and for we think the eaglewinged pride of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts with rivalhating envy set on you to wake our peace which in our countrys cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray and grating shock of wrathful iron arms might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindreds blood therefore we banish you our territories you cousin hereford upon pain of life till twice five summers have enrichd our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions but tread the stranger paths of banishment henry bolingbroke your will be done this must my comfort be sun that warms you here shall shine on me and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment king richard ii norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom which i with some unwillingness pronounce the sly slow hours shall not determinate the dateless limit of thy dear exile the hopeless word of never to return breathe i against thee upon pain of life thomas mowbray a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege and all unlookd for from your highness mouth a dearer merit not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air have i deserved at your highness hands the language i have learnd these forty years my native english now i must forego and now my tongues use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp or like a cunning instrument cased up or being open put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony within my mouth you have engaold my tongue doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me i am too old to fawn upon a nurse too far in years to be a pupil now what is thy sentence then but speechless death which robs my tongue from breathing native breath king richard ii it boots thee not to be compassionate after our sentence plaining comes too late thomas mowbray then thus i turn me from my countrys light to dwell in solemn shades of endless night king richard ii return again and take an oath with thee lay on our royal sword your banishd hands swear by the duty that you owe to god our part therein we banish with yourselves to keep the oath that we administer you never shall so help you truth and god embrace each others love in banishment nor never look upon each others face nor never write regreet nor reconcile this louring tempest of your homebred hate nor never by advised purpose meet to plot contrive or complot any ill gainst us our state our subjects or our land henry bolingbroke i swear thomas mowbray and i to keep all this henry bolingbroke norfolk so far as to mine enemy by this time had the king permitted us one of our souls had wanderd in the air banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh as now our flesh is banishd from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm since thou hast far to go bear not along the clogging burthen of a guilty soul thomas mowbray no bolingbroke if ever i were traitor my name be blotted from the book of life and i from heaven banishd as from hence but what thou art god thou and i do know and all too soon i fear the king shall rue farewell my liege now no way can i stray save back to england all the worlds my way king richard ii uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banishd years pluckd four away six frozen winter spent return with welcome home from banishment henry bolingbroke how long a time lies in one little word four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings john of gaunt i thank my liege that in regard of me he shortens four years of my sons exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby for ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my oildried lamp and timebewasted light shall be extinct with age and endless night my inch of taper will be burnt and done and blindfold death not let me see my son king richard ii why uncle thou hast many years to live john of gaunt but not a minute king that thou canst give shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou canst help time to furrow me with age but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath king richard ii thy son is banishd upon good advice whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave why at our justice seemst thou then to lour john of gaunt things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour you urged me as a judge but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father o had it been a stranger not my child to smooth his fault i should have been more mild a partial slander sought i to avoid and in the sentence my own life destroyd alas i lookd when some of you should say i was too strict to make mine own away but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong king richard ii cousin farewell and uncle bid him so six years we banish him and he shall go duke of aumerle cousin farewell what presence must not know from where you do remain let paper show lord marshal my lord no leave take i for i will ride as far as land will let me by your side john of gaunt o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words that thou returnst no greeting to thy friends henry bolingbroke i have too few to take my leave of you when the tongues office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart john of gaunt thy grief is but thy absence for a time henry bolingbroke joy absent grief is present for that time john of gaunt what is six winters they are quickly gone henry bolingbroke to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten john of gaunt call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure henry bolingbroke my heart will sigh when i miscall it so which finds it an inforced pilgrimage john of gaunt the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return henry bolingbroke nay rather every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages and in the end having my freedom boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief john of gaunt all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens teach thy necessity to reason thus there is no virtue like necessity think not the king did banish thee but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit where it perceives it is but faintly borne go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled thee or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime look what thy soul holds dear imagine it to lie that way thou gost not whence thou comest suppose the singing birds musicians the grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light henry bolingbroke o who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summers heat o no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites but lanceth not the sore john of gaunt come come my son ill bring thee on thy way had i thy youth and cause i would not stay henry bolingbroke then englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu my mother and my nurse that bears me yet whereer i wander boast of this i can though banishd yet a trueborn englishman king richard ii we did observe cousin aumerle how far brought you high hereford on his way duke of aumerle i brought high hereford if you call him so but to the next highway and there i left him king richard ii and say what store of parting tears were shed duke of aumerle faith none for me except the northeast wind which then blew bitterly against our faces awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear king richard ii what said our cousin when you parted with him duke of aumerle farewell and for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane the word that taught me craft to counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seemd buried in my sorrows grave marry would the word farewell have lengthend hours and added years to his short banishment he should have had a volume of farewells but since it would not he had none of me king richard ii he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt when time shall call him home from banishment whether our kinsman come to see his friends ourself and bushy bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy what reverence he did throw away on slaves wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune as twere to banish their affects with him off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the tribute of his supple knee with thanks my countrymen my loving friends as were our england in reversion his and he our subjects next degree in hope green well he is gone and with him go these thoughts now for the rebels which stand out in ireland expedient manage must be made my liege ere further leisure yield them further means for their advantage and your highness loss king richard ii we will ourself in person to this war and for our coffers with too great a court and liberal largess are grown somewhat light we are inforced to farm our royal realm the revenue whereof shall furnish us for our affairs in hand if that come short our substitutes at home shall have blank charters whereto when they shall know what men are rich they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold and send them after to supply our wants for we will make for ireland presently bushy what news bushy old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord suddenly taken and hath sent post haste to entreat your majesty to visit him king richard ii where lies he bushy at ely house king richard ii now put it god in the physicians mind to help him to his grave immediately the lining of his coffers shall make coats to deck our soldiers for these irish wars come gentlemen lets all go visit him pray god we may make haste and come too late all amen john of gaunt will the king come that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth duke of york vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath for all in vain comes counsel to his ear john of gaunt o but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain he that no more must say is listend more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose more are mens ends markd than their lives before the setting sun and music at the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than things long past though richard my lifes counsel would not hear my deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear duke of york no it is stoppd with other flattering sounds as praises of whose taste the wise are fond lascivious metres to whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation where doth the world thrust forth a vanity so it be new theres no respect how vile that is not quickly buzzed into his ears then all too late comes counsel to be heard where will doth mutiny with wits regard direct not him whose way himself will choose tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose john of gaunt methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last for violent fires soon burn out themselves small showers last long but sudden storms are short he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder light vanity insatiate cormorant consuming means soon preys upon itself this royal throne of kings this scepterd isle this earth of majesty this seat of mars this other eden demiparadise this fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war this happy breed of men this little world this precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happier lands this blessed plot this earth this realm this england this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings feard by their breed and famous by their birth renowned for their deeds as far from home for christian service and true chivalry as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry of the worlds ransom blessed marys son this land of such dear souls this dear dear land dear for her reputation through the world is now leased out i die pronouncing it like to a tenement or pelting farm england bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of watery neptune is now bound in with shame with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds that england that was wont to conquer others hath made a shameful conquest of itself ah would the scandal vanish with my life how happy then were my ensuing death duke of york the king is come deal mildly with his youth for young hot colts being raged do rage the more queen how fares our noble uncle lancaster king richard ii what comfort man how ist with aged gaunt john of gaunt o how that name befits my composition old gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old within me grief hath kept a tedious fast and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt for sleeping england long time have i watchd watching breeds leanness leanness is all gaunt the pleasure that some fathers feed upon is my strict fast i mean my childrens looks and therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones king richard ii can sick men play so nicely with their names john of gaunt no misery makes sport to mock itself since thou dost seek to kill my name in me i mock my name great king to flatter thee king richard ii should dying men flatter with those that live john of gaunt no no men living flatter those that die king richard ii thou now adying sayst thou flatterest me john of gaunt o no thou diest though i the sicker be king richard ii i am in health i breathe and see thee ill john of gaunt now he that made me knows i see thee ill ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land wherein thou liest in reputation sick and thou too careless patient as thou art commitst thy anointed body to the cure of those physicians that first wounded thee a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown whose compass is no bigger than thy head and yet incaged in so small a verge the waste is no whit lesser than thy land o had thy grandsire with a prophets eye seen how his sons son should destroy his sons from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame deposing thee before thou wert possessd which art possessd now to depose thyself why cousin wert thou regent of the world it were a shame to let this land by lease but for thy world enjoying but this land is it not more than shame to shame it so landlord of england art thou now not king thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou king richard ii a lunatic leanwitted fool presuming on an agues privilege darest with thy frozen admonition make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood with fury from his native residence now by my seats right royal majesty wert thou not brother to great edwards son this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders john of gaunt o spare me not my brother edwards son for that i was his father edwards son that blood already like the pelican hast thou tappd out and drunkenly caroused my brother gloucester plain wellmeaning soul whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls may be a precedent and witness good that thou respectst not spilling edwards blood join with the present sickness that i have and thy unkindness be like crooked age to crop at once a too long witherd flower live in thy shame but die not shame with thee these words hereafter thy tormentors be convey me to my bed then to my grave love they to live that love and honour have king richard ii and let them die that age and sullens have for both hast thou and both become the grave duke of york i do beseech your majesty impute his words

all be as it is northumberland my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty king richard ii what says he northumberland nay nothing all is said his tongue is now a stringless instrument words life and all old lancaster hath spent duke of york be york the next that must be bankrupt so though death be poor it ends a mortal woe king richard ii the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he his time is spent our pilgrimage must be so much for that now for our irish wars we must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns which live like venom where no venom else but only they have privilege to live and for these great affairs do ask some charge towards our assistance we do seize to us the plate corn revenues and moveables whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possessd duke of york how long shall i be patient ah how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong not gloucesters death nor herefords banishment not gaunts rebukes nor englands private wrongs nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke about his marriage nor my own disgrace have ever made me sour my patient cheek or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face i am the last of noble edwards sons of whom thy father prince of wales was first in war was never lion raged more fierce in peace was never gentle lamb more mild than was that young and princely gentleman his face thou hast for even so lookd he accomplishd with the number of thy hours but when he frownd it was against the french and not against his friends his noble hand did will what he did spend and spent not that which his triumphant fathers hand had won his hands were guilty of no kindred blood but bloody with the enemies of his kin o richard york is too far gone with grief or else he never would compare between king richard ii why uncle whats the matter duke of york o my liege pardon me if you please if not i pleased not to be pardond am content withal seek you to seize and gripe into your hands the royalties and rights of banishd hereford is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live was not gaunt just and is not harry true did not the one deserve to have an heir is not his heir a welldeserving son take herefords rights away and take from time his charters and his customary rights let not tomorrow then ensue today be not thyself for how art thou a king but by fair sequence and succession now afore godgod forbid i say true if you do wrongfully seize herefords rights call in the letters patent that he hath by his attorneysgeneral to sue his livery and deny his offerd homage you pluck a thousand dangers on your head you lose a thousand welldisposed hearts and prick my tender patience to those thoughts which honour and allegiance cannot think king richard ii think what you will we seize into our hands his plate his goods his money and his lands duke of york ill not be by the while my liege farewell what will ensue hereof theres none can tell but by bad courses may be understood that their events can never fall out good king richard ii go bushy to the earl of wiltshire straight bid him repair to us to ely house to see this business tomorrow next we will for ireland and tis time i trow and we create in absence of ourself our uncle york lord governor of england for he is just and always loved us well come on our queen tomorrow must we part be merry for our time of stay is short northumberland well lords the duke of lancaster is dead lord ross and living too for now his son is duke lord willoughby barely in title not in revenue northumberland richly in both if justice had her right lord ross my heart is great but it must break with silence eret be disburdend with a liberal tongue northumberland nay speak thy mind and let him neer speak more that speaks thy words again to do thee harm lord willoughby tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford if it be so out with it boldly man quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him lord ross no good at all that i can do for him unless you call it good to pity him bereft and gelded of his patrimony northumberland now afore god tis shame such wrongs are borne in him a royal prince and many moe of noble blood in this declining land the king is not himself but basely led by flatterers and what they will inform merely in hate gainst any of us all that will the king severely prosecute gainst us our lives our children and our heirs lord ross the commons hath he pilld with grievous taxes and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts lord willoughby and daily new exactions are devised as blanks benevolences and i wot not what but what o gods name doth become of this northumberland wars have not wasted it for warrd he hath not but basely yielded upon compromise that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows more hath he spent in peace than they in wars lord ross the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm lord willoughby the kings grown bankrupt like a broken man northumberland reproach and dissolution hangeth over him lord ross he hath not money for these irish wars his burthenous taxations notwithstanding but by the robbing of the banishd duke northumberland his noble kinsman most degenerate king but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing yet see no shelter to avoid the storm we see the wind sit sore upon our sails and yet we strike not but securely perish lord ross we see the very wreck that we must suffer and unavoided is the danger now for suffering so the causes of our wreck northumberland not so even through the hollow eyes of death i spy life peering but i dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is lord willoughby nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours lord ross be confident to speak northumberland we three are but thyself and speaking so thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold northumberland then thus i have from port le blanc a bay in brittany received intelligence that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham that late broke from the duke of exeter his brother archbishop late of canterbury sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint all these well furnishd by the duke of bretagne with eight tall ships three thousand men of war are making hither with all due expedience and shortly mean to touch our northern shore perhaps they had ere this but that they stay the first departing of the king for ireland if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke imp out our drooping countrys broken wing redeem from broking pawn the blemishd crown wipe off the dust that hides our sceptres gilt and make high majesty look like itself away with me in post to ravenspurgh but if you faint as fearing to do so stay and be secret and myself will go lord ross to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear lord willoughby hold out my horse and i will first be there bushy madam your majesty is too much sad you promised when you parted with the king to lay aside lifeharming heaviness and entertain a cheerful disposition queen to please the king i did to please myself i cannot do it yet i know no cause why i should welcome such a guest as grief save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard yet again methinks some unborn sorrow ripe in fortunes womb is coming towards me and my inward soul with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves more than with parting from my lord the king bushy each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows which shows like grief itself but is not so for sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears divides one thing entire to many objects like perspectives which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion eyed awry distinguish form so your sweet majesty looking awry upon your lords departure find shapes of grief more than himself to wail which lookd on as it is is nought but shadows of what it is not then thricegracious queen more than your lords departure weep not mores not seen or if it be tis with false sorrows eye which for things true weeps things imaginary queen it may be so but yet my inward soul persuades me it is otherwise howeer it be i cannot but be sad so heavy sad as though on thinking on no thought i think makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink bushy tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady queen tis nothing less conceit is still derived from some forefather grief mine is not so for nothing had begot my something grief or something hath the nothing that i grieve tis in reversion that i do possess but what it is that is not yet known what i cannot name tis nameless woe i wot green god save your majesty and well met gentlemen i hope the king is not yet shippd for ireland queen why hopest thou so tis better hope he is for his designs crave haste his haste good hope then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shippd green that he our hope might have retired his power and driven into despair an enemys hope who strongly hath set footing in this land the banishd bolingbroke repeals himself and with uplifted arms is safe arrived at ravenspurgh queen now god in heaven forbid green ah madam tis too true and that is worse the lord northumberland his son young henry percy the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby with all their powerful friends are fled to him bushy why have you not proclaimd northumberland and all the rest revolted faction traitors green we have whereupon the earl of worcester hath broke his staff resignd his stewardship and all the household servants fled with him to bolingbroke queen so green thou art the midwife to my woe and bolingbroke my sorrows dismal heir now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy and i a gasping newdeliverd mother have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joind bushy despair not madam queen who shall hinder me i will despair and be at enmity with cozening hope he is a flatterer a parasite a keeper back of death who gently would dissolve the bands of life which false hope lingers in extremity green here comes the duke of york queen with signs of war about his aged neck o full of careful business are his looks uncle for gods sake speak comfortable words duke of york should i do so i should belie my thoughts comforts in heaven and we are on the earth where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief your husband he is gone to save far off whilst others come to make him lose at home here am i left to underprop his land who weak with age cannot support myself now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made now shall he try his friends that flatterd him servant my lord your son was gone before i came duke of york he was why so go all which way it will the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold and will i fear revolt on herefords side sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester bid her send me presently a thousand pound hold take my ring servant my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship today as i came by i called there but i shall grieve you to report the rest duke of york what ist knave servant an hour before i came the duchess died duke of york god for his mercy what a tide of woes comes rushing on this woeful land at once i know not what to do i would to god so my untruth had not provoked him to it the king had cut off my head with my brothers what are there no posts dispatchd for ireland how shall we do for money for these wars come sistercousin i would saypray pardon me go fellow get thee home provide some carts and bring away the armour that is there gentlemen will you go muster men if i know how or which way to order these affairs thus thrust disorderly into my hands never believe me both are my kinsmen the one is my sovereign whom both my oath and duty bids defend the other again is my kinsman whom the king hath wrongd whom conscience and my kindred bids to right well somewhat we must do come cousin ill dispose of you gentlemen go muster up your men and meet me presently at berkeley i should to plashy too but time will not permit all is uneven and every thing is left at six and seven bushy the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland but none returns for us to levy power proportionable to the enemy is all unpossible green besides our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king bagot and thats the wavering commons for their love lies in their purses and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate bushy wherein the king stands generally condemnd bagot if judgement lie in them then so do we because we ever have been near the king green well i will for refuge straight to bristol castle the earl of wiltshire is already there bushy thither will i with you for little office the hateful commons will perform for us except like curs to tear us all to pieces will you go along with us bagot no i will to ireland to his majesty farewell if hearts presages be not vain we three here art that neer shall meet again bushy thats as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke green alas poor duke the task he undertakes is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry where one on his side fights thousands will fly farewell at once for once for all and ever bushy well we may meet again

draws out our miles and makes them wearisome and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar making the hard way sweet and delectable but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found in ross and willoughby wanting your company which i protest hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoyd by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short as mine hath done by sight of what i have your noble company henry bolingbroke of much less value is my company than your good words but who comes here northumberland it is my son young harry percy sent from my brother worcester whencesoever harry how fares your uncle henry percy i had thought my lord to have learnd his health of you northumberland why is he not with the queen henry percy no my good lord he hath forsook the court broken his staff of office and dispersed the household of the king northumberland what was his reason he was not so resolved when last we spake together henry percy because your lordship was proclaimed traitor but he my lord is

the possession of a royal bed and staind the beauty of a fair queens cheeks with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs myself a prince by fortune of my birth near to the king in blood and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me have stoopd my neck under your injuries and sighd my english breath in foreign clouds eating the bitter bread of banishment whilst you have fed upon my

gentleman this and much more much more than twice all this condemns you to the death see them deliverd over to execution and the hand of death bushy more welcome is the stroke of death to me than

smiles in meeting so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth and do thee favours with my royal hands feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom and heavygaited toads lie in their way doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies mock not my senseless conjuration lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellions arms bishop of carlisle fear not my lord that power that made you king hath power to keep you king in spite of all the means that heaven yields must be embraced and not neglected else if heaven would and we will not heavens offer we refuse the profferd means of succor and redress duke of aumerle he means my lord that we are too remiss whilst bolingbroke through our security grows strong and great in substance and in power king richard ii discomfortable cousin knowst thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid behind the globe that lights the lower world then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage boldly here but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole then murders treasons and detested sins the cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs stand bare and naked trembling at themselves so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke who all this while hath revelld in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes shall see us rising in our throne the east his treasons will sit blushing in his face not able to endure the sight of day but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath pressd to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right welcome my lord how far off lies your power earl of salisbury nor near nor farther off my gracious lord than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue and bids me speak of nothing but despair one day too late i fear me noble lord hath clouded all thy happy days

your highness is so armd to bear the tidings of calamity like an unseasonable stormy day which makes the silver rivers drown their shores as if the world were all dissolved to tears so high above his

stop my lord where rude misgovernd hands from windows tops threw dust and rubbish on king richards head duke of york then as i said the duke great bolingbroke mounted upon a hot and fiery steed which his aspiring rider seemd to know with slow but stately pace kept on his course whilst all tongues cried god save thee bolingbroke you would have thought the very windows spake so many greedy looks of young and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke whilst he from the one side to the other turning bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck bespake them thus i thank you countrymen and thus still doing thus he passd along duchess of york alack poor richard where rode he the whilst duke of york as in a theatre the eyes of men after a wellgraced actor leaves the stage are idly bent on him that enters next thinking his prattle to be tedious even so or with much more contempt mens eyes did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home but dust was thrown upon his sacred head which with such gentle sorrow he shook off his face still combating with tears and smiles the badges of his grief and patience that had not god for some strong purpose steeld the hearts of men they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him but heaven hath a hand in these events to whose high will we bound our calm contents to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now whose state and honour i for aye allow duchess of

effeminate boy takes on the point of honour to support so dissolute a crew henry percy my lord some two days since i saw the prince and told him of those triumphs held at oxford henry bolingbroke and what said the gallant henry percy his answer was he would unto the stews and from the commonst creature pluck a glove and wear it as a favour and with that he would unhorse the lustiest challenger

lookd on me and who should say i would thou wert the man that would divorce this terror from my heart meaning the king at pomfret come lets go i am the kings friend and will rid his foe king richard ii i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet ill hammer it out my brain ill prove the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of stillbreeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humours like the people of this world for no thought is contented the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixd with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus come little ones and then again it is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needles eye thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortunes slaves nor shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one person many people and none contented sometimes am i king then treasons make me wish myself a beggar and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kingd again and by and by think that i am unkingd by bolingbroke and straight am nothing but whateer i be nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased with being nothing music do i hear ha ha keep time how sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept so is it in the music of mens lives and here have i the daintiness of ear to cheque time broke in a disorderd string but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke i wasted time and now doth time waste me for now hath time made me his numbering clock my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch whereto my finger like a dials point is pointing still in cleansing them from tears now sir the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans show minutes times and hours but my time runs posting on in bolingbrokes proud joy while i stand fooling here his jack o the clock this music mads me let it sound no more for though it have holp madmen to their wits in me it seems it will make wise men mad yet blessing on his heart that gives it me for tis a sign of love and love to richard is a strange brooch in this allhating world groom hail royal prince king richard ii thanks noble peer the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear what art thou and how comest thou hither where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live groom i was a poor groom

london streets that coronationday when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary that horse that thou so often hast bestrid that horse that i so carefully have dressd king richard ii rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend how went he under him groom so proudly as if he disdaind the ground king richard ii so proud that bolingbroke was on his back that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand this hand hath made him proud with clapping him would he not stumble would he not fall down since pride must have a fall and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back forgiveness horse why do i rail

am he was not at this fray benvolio madam an hour before the worshippd sun peerd forth the golden window of the east a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the citys side so early walking did i see your son towards him i made but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood i measuring his affections by my own that most are busied when theyre most alone pursued my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me montague many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the allcheering sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from auroras bed away from the light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove benvolio my noble uncle do you know the cause montague i neither know it nor can learn of him benvolio have you importuned him by any means montague both by myself and many other friends but he his own affections counsellor is to himselfi will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know benvolio see where he comes

dreamd a dream tonight mercutio and so did i romeo well what was yours mercutio that dreamers often lie romeo in bed asleep while they do dream things true mercutio o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agatestone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart mens noses as they lie asleep her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers the traces of the smallest spiders web the collars of the moonshines watery beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her wagoner a small greycoated gnat not so big as a round little worm prickd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths fivefathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she romeo peace peace mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing mercutio true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angerd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dewdropping south benvolio this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves supper is done and we shall come too late romeo i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this nights revels and expire the term of a despised life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail on lusty gentlemen benvolio strike drum first servant wheres potpan

supposed he must complain and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks being held a foe he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear and she as much in love her means much less to meet her newbeloved any where but passion lends them power time means to meet tempering extremities with extreme sweet romeo can i go forward when my heart is here turn back dull earth and

himself among these trees to be consorted with the humorous night blind is his love and best befits the dark mercutio if love be blind love cannot hit the mark now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone romeo that she were o that she were an open et caetera thou a poperin pear romeo good night ill to my trucklebed this fieldbed is too cold for me to sleep come shall we go benvolio go then for tis in vain to seek him here that means not to be found romeo he jests at scars that never felt a wound but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off it is my lady o it is my love o that she knew she were she speaks yet she says nothing what of that her eye discourses i will answer it i am too bold tis not to me she speaks two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return what if her eyes were there they in her head the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night see how she leans her cheek upon her hand o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek juliet ay me romeo she speaks o speak again bright angel for thou art as glorious to this night being oer my head as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air juliet o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and ill no longer be a capulet romeo juliet tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a montague whats montague it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man o be some other name whats in a name that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet so romeo would were he not romeo calld retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title romeo doff thy name and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself romeo i take thee at thy word call me but love and ill be new baptized henceforth i never will be romeo juliet what man art thou that thus bescreend in night so stumblest on my counsel romeo by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee had i it written i would tear the word juliet my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of that tongues utterance yet i know the sound art thou not romeo and a montague romeo neither fair saint if either thee dislike juliet how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore the orchard walls are high and hard to climb and the place death considering who thou art if any of my kinsmen find thee here romeo with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls for stony limits cannot hold love out and what love can do that dares love attempt therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me juliet if they do see thee they will murder thee romeo alack there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet and i am proof against their enmity juliet i would not for the world they saw thee here romeo i have nights cloak to hide me from their sight and but thou love me let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love juliet by whose direction foundst thou out this place romeo by love who first did prompt me to inquire he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore washd with the farthest sea i would adventure for such merchandise juliet thou knowst the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke but farewell compliment dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay and i will take thy word yet if thou swearst thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries then say jove laughs o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully or if thou thinkst i am too quickly won ill frown and be perverse an say thee nay so thou wilt woo but else not for the world in truth fair montague i am too fond and therefore thou mayst think my havior light but trust me gentleman ill prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange i should have been more strange i must confess but that thou overheardst ere i was ware my true loves passion therefore pardon me and not impute this yielding to light love which the dark night hath so discovered romeo lady by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruittree tops juliet o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon that monthly changes in her circled orb lest that thy love prove likewise variable romeo what shall i swear by juliet do not swear at all or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and ill believe thee romeo if my hearts dear love juliet well do not swear although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens sweet good night this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet good night good night as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast romeo o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied juliet what satisfaction canst thou have tonight romeo the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine juliet i gave thee mine

doth depend this but begins the woe others must end benvolio here comes the furious tybalt back again romeo alive in triumph and mercutio slain away to heaven respective lenity and fireeyed fury be my conduct now now tybalt take the villain back again that late thou gavest me for mercutios soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company either thou or i or both must go with him tybalt thou wretched boy that didst consort him here shalt with him hence romeo this shall determine that benvolio romeo away be gone the citizens are up and tybalt slain stand not amazed

husband o the blood is spilt o my dear kinsman prince as thou art true for blood of ours shed blood of montague o cousin cousin prince benvolio who began this bloody fray benvolio tybalt here slain whom romeos hand did slay romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urged withal your high displeasure all this uttered with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it romeo he cries aloud hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertaind revenge and to t they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain and as he fell did romeo turn and fly this is the truth or let benvolio die lady capulet he is a kinsman to the montague affection makes him false he speaks not true some twenty of them fought in this black strife and all those twenty could but kill one life i beg for justice which thou prince must give romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live prince romeo slew him he slew mercutio who now the price of his dear blood doth owe montague not romeo prince he was mercutios friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt prince and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence i have an interest in your hates proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding but ill amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses

father capulet will have it so and i am nothing slow to slack his haste friar laurence you say you do not know the ladys mind uneven is the course i like it not paris immoderately she weeps for tybalts death and therefore have i little talkd of love for venus smiles not in a house of tears now sir her father counts it dangerous that she doth give her sorrow so much sway and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation of her tears which too much minded by herself alone may be put from her by society now do you know the reason of this haste friar laurence paris happily met my lady and my wife juliet that may be sir when i may be a wife paris that may be must be love on thursday next juliet what must be shall be friar laurence thats a certain text paris come you to make

me juliet if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face paris poor soul thy face is much abused with tears juliet the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite paris thou wrongst it more than tears with that report juliet that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face paris thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it juliet it may be so for it is not mine own are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass friar laurence my leisure serves me pensive daughter now my lord we must entreat the time alone paris god shield i should disturb devotion juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye till then adieu and keep this holy kiss juliet o shut the door and when thou

thursday next be married to this county juliet tell me not friar that thou hearst of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife ill help it presently god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo seald shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both therefore out of thy longexperienced time give me some present counsel or behold twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring be not so long to speak i long to die if what thou speakst speak not of remedy friar laurence hold daughter i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent if rather than to marry county paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame that copest with death himself to scape from it and if thou darest ill give thee remedy juliet o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of yonder tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a newmade grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love friar laurence hold then go home be merry give consent to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow tomorrow night look that thou lie alone let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilled liquor drink thou off when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse shall keep his native progress but surcease no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall like death when he shuts up the day of life each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death and in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours and then awake as from a pleasant sleep now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead then as the manner of our country is in thy best robes uncoverd on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie in the mean time against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and he and i will watch thy waking and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua and this shall free thee from this present shame if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valour in the acting it juliet give me give me o tell not me of fear friar laurence hold get you gone be strong and prosperous in this resolve ill send a friar with speed to mantua with my letters to thy lord juliet love give me strength and strength shall help afford farewell dear father capulet so many guests invite as here are writ sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks second

tomorrow morning no no this shall forbid it lie thou there what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministerd to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd because he married me before to romeo i fear it is and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me theres a fearful point shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for these many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies festering in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad o if i wake shall i not be distraught environed with all these hideous fears and madly play with my forefathers joints and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone as with a club dash out my desperate brains o look methinks i see my cousins ghost seeking out romeo

both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excused prince then say at once what thou dost know in this friar laurence i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife i married them and their stoln marriageday was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothd and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutord by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowd grave being the time the potions force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayd by accident and yesternight returnd my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law prince we still have known thee for a holy man wheres romeos man what can he say in this balthasar i brought my master news of juliets death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument this letter he early bid me give his father and threatened me with death going in the vault i departed not and left him there prince give me the letter i will look on it where is the countys page that raised the watch sirrah what made your master in this place page he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and by and by my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch prince this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd capulet o brother montague give me thy hand this is my daughters jointure for no more can i demand montague but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that while verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet capulet as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie poor sacrifices of our enmity prince a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardond and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo warwick i wonder how the king escaped our hands

enforced me queen margaret enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch thou hast undone thyself thy son and me and given unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance to entail him and his heirs unto the crown what is it but to make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy time warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas the duke is made protector of the realm and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves had i been there which am a silly woman the soldiers should have tossd me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act but thou preferrst thy life before thine honour and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself both from thy table henry and thy bed until that act of parliament be repeald whereby my son is disinherited the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours will follow mine if once

vi richard brother though i be youngest give me leave edward no i can better play the orator montague but i have reasons strong and forcible york why how now sons and brother at a strife what is your quarrel how began it first edward no quarrel but a slight contention york about what richard about that which concerns your grace and us the crown of england father which is yours york mine boy not till king henry be dead richard your right depends not on his life or death edward now you are heir therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe it will outrun you father in the end york i took an oath that he should quietly reign edward but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year richard no god forbid your grace should be forsworn york i shall be if i claim by open war richard ill prove the contrary if youll hear me speak york thou canst not son it is impossible richard an oath is of no moment being not took before a true and lawful magistrate that hath authority over him that swears henry had none but did usurp the place then seeing twas he that made you to depose your oath my lord is vain and frivolous therefore to arms and father do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy why do we finger thus i cannot rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henrys heart york richard enough i will be king or die brother thou shalt to london presently and whet on warwick to this enterprise thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk and tell him privily of our intent you edward shall unto my lord cobham with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust for they are soldiers witty courteous liberal full of spirit while you are thus employd what resteth more but that i seek occasion how to rise and yet the king not privy to my drift nor any of the house of lancaster but stay what news why comest thou in such post messenger the queen with all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in your castle she is hard by with twenty thousand men and therefore fortify your hold my lord york ay with my sword what thinkst thou that we fear them edward and richard you shall stay with me my brother montague shall post to london let noble warwick cobham and the rest whom we have left protectors of the king with powerful policy strengthen themselves and trust not simple henry nor his oaths montague brother i go ill win them fear it not and thus most humbly i do take my leave sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles you are come to sandal in a happy hour the army of the queen mean to besiege us john mortimer she shall not need well meet her in the field york what with five thousand men richard ay with five hundred father for a need a womans general what should we fear edward i hear their drums lets set our men in order and issue forth and bid them battle straight york five men to twenty though the odds be great i doubt not uncle of our victory many a battle have i won in france when as the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success king henry vi rutland ah whither shall i fly to scape their hands ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes clifford chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life as for the brat of this accursed duke whose father slew my father he shall die tutor and i my lord will bear him company clifford soldiers away with him tutor ah clifford murder not this innocent child lest thou be hated both of god and man clifford how now is he dead already or is it fear that makes him close his eyes ill open them rutland so looks the pentup lion oer the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws and so he walks insulting oer his prey and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword and not with such a cruel threatening look sweet clifford hear me speak before i die i am too mean a subject for thy wrath be thou revenged on men and let me live clifford in vain thou speakst poor boy my fathers blood hath stoppd the passage where thy words should enter rutland then let my fathers blood open it again he is a man and clifford cope with him clifford had thy brethren here their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me no if i diggd up thy forefathers graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul and till i root out their accursed line and leave not one alive i live in hell therefore rutland o let me pray before i take my death to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me clifford such pity as my rapiers point affords rutland i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me clifford thy father hath rutland but twas ere i was born thou hast one son for his sake pity me lest in revenge thereof sith god is just he be as miserably slain as i ah let me live in prison all my days and when i give occasion of offence then let me die for now thou hast no cause clifford no cause thy father slew my father therefore die rutland di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae clifford plantagenet i come plantagenet and this thy sons blood cleaving to my blade shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood congeald with this do make me wipe off both king henry vi york the army of the queen hath got the field my uncles both are slain in rescuing me and all my followers to the eager foe turn back and fly like ships before the wind or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves my sons god knows what hath bechanced them but this i know they have demeand themselves like men born to renown by life or death three times did richard make a lane to me and thrice cried courage father fight it out and full as oft came edward to my side with purple falchion painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encounterd him and when the hardiest warriors did retire richard cried charge and give no foot of ground and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre with this we charged again but out alas we bodged again as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with overmatching waves ah hark the fatal followers do pursue and i am faint and cannot fly their fury and were i strong i would not shun their fury the sands are numberd that make up my life here must i stay and here my life must end come bloody clifford rough northumberland i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt and i abide your shot northumberland yield to our mercy proud plantagenet clifford ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm with downright payment showd unto my father now phaethon hath tumbled from his car and made an evening at the noontide prick york my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven scorning whateer you can afflict me with why come you not what multitudes and fear clifford so cowards fight when they can fly no further so doves do peck the falcons piercing talons so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives breathe out invectives gainst the officers york o clifford but bethink thee once again and in thy thought oerrun my former time and if though canst for blushing view this face and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this clifford i will not bandy with thee word for word but buckle with thee blows twice two for one queen margaret hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitors life wrath makes him deaf speak thou northumberland northumberland hold clifford do not honour him so much to prick thy finger though to wound his heart what valour were it when a cur doth grin for one to thrust his hand between his teeth when he might spurn him with his foot away it is wars prize to take all vantages and ten to one is no impeach of valour clifford ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin northumberland so doth the cony struggle in the net york so triumph thieves upon their conquerd booty so true men yield with robbers so oermatchd northumberland what would your grace have done unto him now queen margaret brave warriors clifford and northumberland come make him stand upon this molehill here that raught at mountains with outstretched arms yet parted but the shadow with his hand what was it you that would be englands king wast you that revelld in our parliament and made a preachment of your high descent where are your mess of sons to back you now the wanton edward and the lusty george and wheres that valiant crookback prodigy dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies or with the rest where is your darling rutland look york i staind this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford with his rapiers point made issue from the bosom of the boy and if thine eyes can water for his death i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly i should lament thy miserable state i prithee grieve to make me merry york what hath thy fiery heart so parchd thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutlands death why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance thou wouldst be feed i see to make me sport york cannot speak unless he wear a crown a crown for york and lords bow low to him hold you his hands whilst i do set it on ay marry sir now looks he like a king ay this is he that took king henrys chair and this is he was his adopted heir but how is it that great plantagenet is crownd so soon and broke his solemn oath as i bethink me you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death and will you pale your head in henrys glory and rob his temples of the diadem now in his life against your holy oath o tis a fault too too unpardonable off with the crown and with the crown his head and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead clifford that is my office for my fathers sake queen margaret nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes york shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth how illbeseeming is it in thy sex to triumph like an amazonian trull upon their woes whom fortune captivates but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging made impudent with use of evil deeds i would assay proud queen to make thee blush to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless thy father bears the type of king of naples of both the sicils and jerusalem yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen unless the adage must be verified that beggars mounted run their horse to death tis beauty that doth oft make women proud but god he knows thy share thereof is small tis virtue that doth make them most admired the contrary doth make thee wonderd at tis government that makes them seem divine the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us or as the south to the septentrion o tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child to bid the father wipe his eyes withal and yet be seen to bear a womans face women are soft mild pitiful and flexible thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless bidst thou me rage why now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep why now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers and when the rage allays the rain begins these tears are my sweet rutlands obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death gainst thee fell clifford and thee false frenchwoman northumberland beshrew me but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears york that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touchd would not have staind with blood but you are more inhuman more inexorable o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania see ruthless queen a hapless fathers tears this cloth thou dipdst in blood of my sweet boy and i with tears do wash the blood away keep thou the napkin and go boast of this and if thou tellst the heavy story right upon my soul the hearers will shed tears yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears and say alas it was a piteous deed there take the crown and with the crown my curse and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand hardhearted clifford take me from the world my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads northumberland had he been slaughterman to all my kin i should not for my life but weep with him to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul queen margaret what weepingripe my lord northumberland think but upon the wrong he did us all and that will quickly dry thy melting tears clifford heres for my oath heres for my fathers death queen margaret and heres to right our gentlehearted king york open thy gate of mercy gracious god my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee queen margaret off with his head and set it on york gates so york may overlook the town of york king henry vi edward i wonder how our princely father scaped or whether he be scaped away or no from cliffords and northumberlands pursuit had he been taen we should have heard the news had he been slain we should have heard the news or had he scaped methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape how fares my brother why is he so sad richard i cannot joy until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become i saw him in the battle range about and watchd him how he singled clifford forth methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat or as a bear encompassd round with dogs who having pinchd a few and made them cry the rest stand all aloof and bark at him so fared our father with his enemies so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks tis prize enough to be his son see how the morning opes her golden gates and takes her farewell of the glorious sun how well resembles it the prime of youth trimmd like a younker prancing to his love edward dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns richard three glorious suns each one a perfect sun not separated with the racking clouds but severd in a pale clearshining sky see see they join embrace and seem to kiss as if they vowd some league inviolable now are they but one lamp one light one sun in this the heaven figures some event edward tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of i think it cites us brother to the field that we the sons of brave plantagenet each one already blazing by our meeds should notwithstanding join our lights together and overshine the earth as this the world whateer it bodes henceforward will i bear upon my target three fairshining suns richard nay bear three daughters by your leave i speak it you love the breeder better than the male but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue messenger ah one that was a woful lookeron when as the noble duke of york was slain your princely father and my loving lord edward o speak no more for i have heard too much richard say how he died for i will hear it all messenger environed he was with many foes and stood against them as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enterd troy but hercules himself must yield to odds and many strokes though with a little axe hew down and fell the hardesttimberd oak by many hands your father was subdued but only slaughterd by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen who crownd the gracious duke in high despite laughd in his face and when with grief he wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it doth remain the saddest spectacle that eer i viewd edward sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon now thou art gone we have no staff no stay o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry and treacherously hast thou vanquishd him for hand to hand he would have vanquishd thee now my souls palace is become a prison ah would she break from hence that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest for never henceforth shall i joy again never o never shall i see more joy richard i cannot weep for all my bodys moisture scarce serves to quench my furnaceburning heart nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast and burns me up with flames that tears would quench to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes blows and revenge for me richard i bear thy name ill venge thy death or die renowned by attempting it edward his name that valiant duke hath left with thee his dukedom and his chair with me is left richard nay if thou be that princely eagles bird show thy descent by gazing gainst the sun for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say either that is thine or else thou wert not his warwick how now fair lords what fare what news abroad richard great lord of warwick if we should recount our baleful news and at each words deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told the words would add more anguish than the wounds o valiant lord the duke of york is slain edward o warwick warwick that plantagenet which held three dearly as his souls redemption is by the stern lord clifford done to death warwick ten days ago i drownd these news in tears and now to add more measure to your woes i come to tell you things sith then befalln after the bloody fray at wakefield fought where your brave father breathed his latest gasp tidings as swiftly as the posts could run were brought me of your loss and his depart i then in london keeper of the king musterd my soldiers gatherd flocks of friends and very well appointed as i thought marchd toward saint albans to intercept the queen bearing the king in my behalf along for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henrys oath and your succession short tale to make we at saint albans met our battles joind and both sides fiercely fought but whether twas the coldness of the king who lookd full gently on his warlike queen that robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of cliffords rigour who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight or like an idle thresher with a flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheerd them up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that we fled the king unto the queen lord george your brother norfolk and myself in haste posthaste are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were making another head to fight again edward where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick and when came george from burgundy to england warwick some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers and for your brother he was lately sent from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy with aid of soldiers to this needful war richard twas odds belike when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit but neer till now his scandal of retire warwick nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henrys head and wring the awful sceptre from his fist were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer richard i know it well lord warwick blame me not tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak but in this troublous time whats to be done shall we go throw away our coats of steel and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns numbering our avemaries with our beads or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms if for the last say ay and to it lords warwick why therefore warwick came to seek you out and therefore comes my brother montague attend me lords the proud insulting queen with clifford and the haught northumberland and of their feather many more proud birds have wrought the easymelting king like wax he swore consent to your succession his oath enrolled in the parliament and now to london all the crew are gone to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster their power i think is thirty thousand strong now if the help of norfolk and myself with all the friends that thou brave earl of march amongst the loving welshmen canst procure will but amount to five and twenty thousand why via to london will we march amain and once again bestride our foaming steeds and once again cry charge upon our foes but never once again turn back and fly richard ay now methinks i hear great warwick speak neer may he live to see a sunshine day that cries retire if warwick bid him stay edward lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean and when thou failstas god forbid the hour must edward fall which peril heaven forfend warwick no longer earl of march but duke of york the next degree is englands royal throne for king of england shalt thou be proclaimd in every borough as we pass along and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head king edward valiant richard montague stay we no longer dreaming of renown but sound the trumpets and about our task richard then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds i come to pierce it or to give thee mine edward then strike up drums god and saint george for us warwick how now what news messenger the duke of norfolk sends you word by me the queen is coming with a puissant host and craves your company for speedy counsel warwick why then it sorts brave warriors lets away king henry vi queen margaret welcome my lord to this brave town of york yonders the head of that archenemy that sought to be encompassd with your crown doth not the object cheer your heart my lord king henry vi ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck to see this sight it irks my very soul withhold revenge dear god tis not my fault nor wittingly have i infringed my vow clifford my gracious liege this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside to whom do lions cast their gentle looks not to the beast that would usurp their den whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick not his that spoils her young before her face who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting not he that sets his foot upon her back the smallest worm will turn being trodden on and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood ambitious york doth level at thy crown thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he but a duke would have his son a king and raise his issue like a loving sire thou being a king blest with a goodly son didst yield consent to disinherit him which argued thee a most unloving father unreasonable creatures feed their young and though mans face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who hath not seen them even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climbd unto their nest offer their own lives in their youngs defence for shame my liege make them your precedent were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his fathers fault and long hereafter say unto his child what my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away ah what a shame were this look on the boy and let his manly face which promiseth successful fortune steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him king henry vi full well hath clifford playd the orator inferring arguments of mighty force but clifford tell me didst thou never hear that things illgot had ever bad success and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind and would my father had left me no more for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a thousandfold more care to keep than in possession and jot of pleasure ah cousin york would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here queen margaret my lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh and this soft courage makes your followers faint you promised knighthood to our forward son unsheathe your sword and dub him presently edward kneel down king henry vi edward plantagenet arise a knight and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right prince my gracious father by your kingly leave ill draw it as apparent to the crown and in that quarrel use it to the death clifford why that is spoken like a toward prince messenger royal commanders be in readiness for with a band of thirty thousand men comes warwick backing of the duke of york and in the towns as they do march along proclaims him king and many fly to him darraign your battle for they are at hand clifford i would your highness would depart the field the queen hath best success when you are absent queen margaret ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune king henry vi why thats my fortune too therefore ill stay northumberland be it with resolution then to fight prince edward my royal father cheer these noble lords and hearten those that fight in your defence unsheathe your sword good father cry saint george edward now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace and set thy diadem upon my head or bide the mortal fortune of the field queen margaret go rate thy minions proud insulting boy becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king edward i am his king and he should bow his knee i was adopted heir by his consent since when his oath is broke for as i hear you that are king though he do wear the crown have caused him by new act of parliament to blot out me and put his own son in clifford and reason too who should succeed the father but the son richard are you there butcher o i cannot speak clifford ay crookback here i stand to answer thee or any he the proudest of thy sort richard twas you that killd young rutland was it not clifford ay and old york and yet not satisfied richard for gods sake lords give signal to the fight warwick what sayst thou henry wilt thou yield the crown queen margaret why how now longtongued warwick dare you speak when you and i met at saint albans last your legs did better service than your hands warwick then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine clifford you said so much before and yet you fled warwick twas not your valour clifford drove me thence northumberland no nor your manhood that durst make you stay richard northumberland i hold thee reverently break off the parley for scarce i can refrain the execution of my bigswoln heart upon that clifford that cruel childkiller clifford i slew thy father callst thou him a child richard ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland but ere sunset ill make thee curse the deed king henry vi have done with words my lords and hear me speak queen margaret defy them then or else hold close thy lips king henry vi i prithee give no limits to my tongue i am a king and privileged to speak clifford my liege the wound that bred this meeting here cannot be cured by words therefore be still richard then executioner unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all i am resolved that cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue edward say henry shall i have my right or no a thousand men have broke their fasts today that neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown warwick if thou deny their blood upon thy head for york in justice puts his armour on prince edward if that be right which warwick says is right there is no wrong but every thing is right richard whoever got thee there thy mother stands for well i wot thou hast thy mothers tongue queen margaret but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam but like a foul misshapen stigmatic markd by the destinies to be avoided as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings richard iron of naples hid with english gilt whose father bears the title of a king as if a channel should be calld the sea shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart edward a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns to make this shameless callet know herself helen of greece was fairer far than thou although thy husband may be menelaus and neer was agamemnons brother wrongd by that false woman as this king by thee his father revelld in the heart of france and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop and had he matchd according to his state he might have kept that glory to this day but when he took a beggar to his bed and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday even then that sunshine brewd a shower for him that washd his fathers fortunes forth of france and heapd sedition on his crown at home for what hath broachd this tumult but thy pride hadst thou been meek our title still had slept and we in pity of the gentle king had slippd our claim until another age george but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring and that thy summer bred us no increase we set the axe to thy usurping root and though the edge hath something hit ourselves yet know thou since we have begun to strike well never leave till we have hewn thee down or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods edward and in this resolution i defy thee not willing any longer conference since thou deniest the gentle king to speak sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave and either victory or else a grave queen margaret stay edward edward no wrangling woman well no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day king henry vi warwick forspent with toil as runners with a race i lay me down a little while to breathe for strokes received and many blows repaid have robbd my strongknit sinews of their strength and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile edward smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death for this world frowns and edwards sun is clouded warwick how now my lord what hap what hope of good george our hap is loss our hope but sad despair our ranks are broke and ruin follows us what counsel give you whither shall we fly edward bootless is flight they follow us with wings and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit richard ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk broachd with the steely point of cliffords lance and in the very pangs of death he cried like to a dismal clangour heard from far warwick revenge brother revenge my death so underneath the belly of their steeds that staind their fetlocks in his smoking blood the noble gentleman gave up the ghost warwick then let the earth be drunken with our blood ill kill my horse because i will not fly why stand we like softhearted women here wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage and look upon as if the tragedy were playd in jest by counterfeiting actors here on my knee i vow to god above ill never pause again never stand still till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge edward o warwick i do bend my knee with thine and in this vow do chain my soul to thine and ere my knee rise from the earths cold face i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee thou setter up and plucker down of kings beseeching thee if with they will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope and give sweet passage to my sinful soul now lords take leave until we meet again whereer it be in heaven or in earth richard brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick let me embrace thee in my weary arms i that did never weep now melt with woe that winter should cut off our springtime so warwick away away once more sweet lords farewell george yet let us all together to our troops and give them leave to fly that will not stay and call them pillars that will stand to us and if we thrive promise them such rewards as victors wear at the olympian games this may plant courage in their quailing breasts for yet is hope of life and victory forslow no longer make we hence amain king henry vi richard now clifford i have singled thee alone suppose this arm is for the duke of york and this for rutland both bound to revenge wert thou environd with a brazen wall clifford now richard i am with thee here alone this is the hand that stabbd thy father york and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland and heres the heart that triumphs in their death and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother to execute the like upon thyself and so have at thee richard nay warwick single out some other chase for i myself will hunt this wolf to death king henry vi king henry vi this battle fares like to the mornings war when dying clouds contend with growing light what time the shepherd blowing of his nails can neither call it perfect day nor night now sways it this way like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind now sways it that way like the selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind sometime the flood prevails and then the wind now one the better then another best both tugging to be victors breast to breast yet neither conqueror nor conquered so is the equal of this fell war here on this molehill will i sit me down to whom god will there be the victory for margaret my queen and clifford too have chid me from the battle swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence would i were dead if gods good will were so for what is in this world but grief and woe o god methinks it were a happy life to be no better than a homely swain to sit upon a hill as i do now to carve out dials quaintly point by point thereby to see the minutes how they run how many make the hour full complete how many hours bring about the day how many days will finish up the year how many years a mortal man may live when this is known then to divide the times so many hours must i tend my flock so many hours must i take my rest so many hours must i contemplate so many hours must i sport myself so many days my ewes have been with young so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean so many years ere i shall shear the fleece so minutes hours days months and years passd over to the end they were created would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep than doth a rich embroiderd canopy to kings that fear their subjects treachery o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth and to conclude the shepherds homely curds his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle his wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade all which secure and sweetly he enjoys is far beyond a princes delicates his viands sparkling in a golden cup his body couched in a curious bed when care mistrust and treason waits on him son ill blows the wind that profits nobody this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight may be possessed with some store of crowns and i that haply take them from him now may yet ere night yield both my life and them to some man else as this dead man doth me whos this o god it is my fathers face whom in this conflict i unwares have killd o heavy times begetting such events from london by the king was i pressd forth my father being the earl of warwicks man came on the part of york pressd by his master and i who at his hands received my life him have by my hands of life bereaved him pardon me god i knew not what i did and pardon father for i knew not thee my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks and no more words till they have flowd their fill king henry vi o piteous spectacle o bloody times whiles lions war and battle for their dens poor harmless lambs abide their enmity weep wretched man ill aid thee tear for tear and let our hearts and eyes like civil war be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief father thou that so stoutly hast resisted me give me thy gold if thou hast any gold for i have bought it with an hundred blows but let me see is this our foemans face ah no no no it is mine only son ah boy if any life be left in thee throw up thine eye see see what showers arise blown with the windy tempest of my heart upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart o pity god this miserable age what stratagems how fell how butcherly erroneous mutinous and unnatural this deadly quarrel daily doth beget o boy thy father gave thee life too soon and hath bereft thee of thy life too late king henry vi woe above woe grief more than common grief o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds o pity pity gentle heaven pity the red rose and the white are on his face the fatal colours of our striving houses the one his purple blood right well resembles the other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth wither one rose and let the other flourish if you contend a thousand lives must wither son how will my mother for a fathers death take on with me and neer be satisfied father how will my wife for slaughter of my son shed seas of tears and neer be satisfied king henry vi how will the country for these woful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied son was ever son so rued a fathers death father was ever father so bemoand his son king henry vi was ever king so grieved for subjects woe much is your sorrow mine ten times so much son ill bear thee hence where i may weep my fill father these arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre for from my heart thine image neer shall go my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell and so obsequious will thy father be even for the loss of thee having no more as priam was for all his valiant sons ill bear thee hence and let them fight that will for i have murdered where i should not kill king henry vi sadhearted men much overgone with care here sits a king more woful than you are prince edward fly father fly for all your friends are fled and warwick rages like a chafed bull away for death doth hold us in pursuit queen margaret mount you my lord towards berwick post amain edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds having the fearful flying hare in sight with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath and bloody steel graspd in their ireful hands are at our backs and therefore hence amain exeter away for vengeance comes along with them nay stay not to expostulate make speed or else come after ill away before king henry vi nay take me with thee good sweet exeter not that i fear to stay but love to go whither the queen intends forward away king henry vi clifford here burns my candle out ay here it dies which whiles it lasted gave king henry light o lancaster i fear thy overthrow more than my bodys parting with my soul my love and fear glued many friends to thee and now i fall thy tough commixture melts impairing henry strengthening misproud york the common people swarm like summer flies and whither fly the gnats but to the sun and who shines now but henrys enemies o phoebus hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds thy burning car never had scorchd the earth and henry hadst thou swayd as kings should do or as thy father and his father did giving no ground unto the house of york they never then had sprung like summer flies i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless and will not pity for at their hands i have deserved no pity the air hath got into my deadly wounds and much effuse of blood doth make me faint come york and richard warwick and the rest i stabbd your fathers bosoms split my breast edward now breathe we lords good fortune bids us pause and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen that led calm henry though he were a king as doth a sail filld with a fretting gust command an argosy to stem the waves but think you lords that clifford fled with them warwick no tis impossible he should escape for though before his face i speak the words your brother richard markd him for the grave and wheresoeer he is hes surely dead edward whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave richard a deadly groan like life and deaths departing edward see who it is and now the battles ended if friend or foe let him be gently used richard revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford who not contented that he loppd the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york warwick from off the gates of york fetch down the head your fathers head which clifford placed there instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered edward bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his illboding tongue no more shall speak warwick i think his understanding is bereft speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say richard o would he did and so perhaps he doth tis but his policy to counterfeit because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father george if so thou thinkst vex him with eager words richard clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace edward clifford repent in bootless penitence warwick clifford devise excuses for thy faults george while we devise fell tortures for thy faults richard thou didst love york and i am son to york edward thou pitiedst rutland i will pity thee george wheres captain margaret to fence you now warwick they mock thee clifford swear as thou wast wont richard what not an oath nay then the world goes hard when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath i know by that hes dead and by my soul if this right hand would buy two hours life that i in all despite might rail at him this hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy warwick ay but hes dead off with the traitors head and rear it in the place your fathers stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned englands royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread the scatterd foe that hopes to rise again for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears first will i see the coronation and then to brittany ill cross the sea to effect this marriage so it please my lord edward even as thou

gloucester clarence king edward iv lady grey tis better said than done my gracious lord i am a subject fit to jest withal but far unfit to be a sovereign king edward iv sweet widow by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends and that is to enjoy thee for my love lady grey and that is more than i will yield unto i know i am too mean to be your queen and yet too good to be

gloucester clarence king edward iv brothers you muse what chat we two have had gloucester the widow likes it not for she looks very sad king edward iv youll think it strange if i should marry her clarence to whom my lord king edward iv why clarence to myself gloucester that would be ten days wonder at the least clarence thats a day longer than a wonder lasts gloucester by so much is the wonder in extremes king edward iv well jest on brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husbands lands nobleman my gracious lord henry your foe is taken and brought your prisoner to your palace gate king edward iv see that he be conveyd unto the tower and go we brothers to the man that took him to question of his apprehension widow go you along lords use her honourably gloucester ay edward will use women honourably would he were wasted marrow bones and all that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring to cross me from the golden time i look for and yet between my souls desire and me the lustful edwards title buried is clarence henry and his son young edward and all the unlookd for issue of their bodies to take their rooms ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose why then i do but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies a faroff shore where he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying hell lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown being so far off and so i chide the means that keeps me from it and so i say ill cut the causes off flattering me with impossibilities my eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much unless my hand and strength could equal them well say there is no kingdom then for richard what other pleasure can the world afford ill make my heaven in a ladys lap and deck my body in gay ornaments and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks o miserable thought and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns why love forswore me in my mothers womb and for i should not deal in her soft laws she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe to shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub to make an envious mountain on my back where sits deformity to mock my body to shape my legs of an unequal size to disproportion me in every part like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp that carries no impression like the dam and am i then a man to be beloved o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought then since this earth affords no joy to me but to command to cheque to oerbear such as are of better person than myself ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown and whiles i live to account this world but hell until my misshaped trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown and yet i know not how to get the crown for many lives stand between me and home and ilike one lost in a thorny wood that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns seeking a way and straying from the way not knowing how to find the open air but toiling desperately to find it out torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself or hew my way out with a bloody axe why i can smile and murder whiles i smile and cry content to that which grieves my heart and wet my cheeks with artificial tears and frame my face to all occasions ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall ill slay more gazers than the basilisk ill play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slily than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colours to the chameleon change shapes with proteus for advantages and set the murderous machiavel to school can i do this and cannot get a crown tut were it farther off ill pluck it down king henry vi king lewis xi fair queen of england worthy margaret sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit queen margaret no mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command i was i must confess great albions queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down and with dishonour laid me on the ground where i must take like seat unto my fortune and to my humble seat conform myself king lewis xi why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair queen margaret from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares king lewis xi whateer it be be thou still like thyself and sit thee by our side yield not thy neck to fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief it shall be eased if france can yield relief queen margaret those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak now therefore be it known to noble lewis that henry sole possessor of my love is of a king become a banishd man and forced to live in scotland a forlorn while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of englands trueanointed lawful king this is the cause that i poor margaret with this my son prince edward henrys heir am come to crave thy just and lawful aid and if thou fail us all our hope is done scotland hath will to help but cannot help our people and our peers are both misled our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight king lewis xi renowned queen with patience calm the storm while we bethink a means to break it off queen margaret the more we stay the stronger grows our foe king lewis xi the more i stay the more ill succor thee queen margaret o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow king lewis xi whats he approacheth boldly to our presence queen margaret our earl of warwick edwards greatest friend king lewis xi welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france queen margaret ay now begins a second storm to rise for this is he that moves both wind and tide warwick from worthy edward king of albion my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend i come in kindness and unfeigned love first to do greetings to thy royal person and then to crave a league of amity and lastly to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister to englands king in lawful marriage queen margaret warwick queen margaret king lewis and lady bona hear me speak before you answer warwick his demand springs not from edwards wellmeant honest love but from deceit bred by necessity for how can tyrants safely govern home unless abroad they purchase great alliance to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice that henry liveth still but were he dead yet here prince edward stands king henrys son look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour for though usurpers sway the rule awhile yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs warwick injurious margaret prince edward and why not queen warwick because thy father henry did usurp and thou no more are prince than she is queen oxford then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt which did subdue the greatest part of spain and after john of gaunt henry the fourth whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest and after that wise prince henry the fifth who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends warwick oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten methinks these peers of france should smile at that but for the rest you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years a silly time to make prescription for a kingdoms worth oxford why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years and not bewray thy treason with a blush warwick can oxford that did ever fence the right now buckler falsehood with a pedigree for shame leave henry and call edward king oxford call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother the lord aubrey vere was done to death and more than so my father even in the downfall of his mellowd years when nature brought him to the door of death no warwick no while life upholds this arm this arm upholds the house of lancaster warwick and i the house of york king lewis xi queen margaret prince edward and oxford vouchsafe at our request to stand aside while i use further conference with warwick queen margaret heavens grant that warwicks words bewitch him not king lewis xi now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience is edward your true king for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen warwick thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour king lewis xi but is he gracious in the peoples eye warwick the more that henry was unfortunate king lewis xi then further all dissembling set aside tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona warwick such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground the leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun exempt from envy but not from disdain unless the lady bona quit his pain king lewis xi now sister let us hear your firm resolve bona your grant or your denial shall be mine yet i confess that often ere this day when i have heard your kings desert recounted mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire king lewis xi then warwick thus our sister shall be edwards and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make which with her dowry shall be counterpoised draw near queen margaret and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king prince edward to edward but not to the english king queen margaret deceitful warwick it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henrys friend king lewis xi and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak as may appear by edwards good success then tis but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield warwick henry now lives in scotland at his ease where having nothing nothing can he lose and as for you yourself our quondam queen you have a father able to maintain you and better twere you troubled him than france queen margaret peace impudent and shameless warwick peace proud setter up and puller down of kings i will not hence till with my talk and tears both full of truth i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love for both of you are birds of selfsame feather king lewis xi warwick this is some post to us or thee post oxford i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his prince edward nay mark how lewis stamps as he were nettled i hope alls for the best king lewis xi warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen queen margaret mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys warwick mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent king lewis xi what has your king married the lady grey and now to soothe your forgery and his sends me a paper to persuade me patience is this the alliance that he seeks with france dare he presume to scorn us in this manner queen margaret i told your majesty as much before this proveth edwards love and warwicks honesty warwick king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss that i am clear from this misdeed of edwards no more my king for he dishonours me but most himself if he could see his shame did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death did i let pass the abuse done to my niece did i impale him with the regal crown did i put henry from his native right and am i guerdond at the last with shame shame on himself for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him i here renounce him and return to henry my noble queen let former grudges pass and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona and replant henry in his former state queen margaret warwick these words have turnd my hate to love and i forgive and quite forget old faults and joy that thou becomest king henrys friend warwick so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers ill undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war tis not his newmade bride shall succor him and as for clarence as my letters tell me hes very likely now to fall from him for matching more for wanton lust than honour or than for strength and safety of our country bona dear brother how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen queen margaret renowned prince how shall poor henry live unless thou rescue him from foul despair bona my quarrel and this english queens are one warwick and mine fair lady bona joins with yours king lewis xi and mine with hers and thine and margarets therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid queen margaret let me give humble thanks for all at once king lewis xi then englands messenger return in post and tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal bona tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willow garland for his sake queen margaret tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside and i am ready to put armour on warwick tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long theres thy reward be gone king lewis xi but warwick thou and oxford with five thousand men shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle and as occasion serves this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty warwick this shall assure my constant loyalty that if our queen and this young prince agree ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands queen margaret yes i agree and thank you for your motion son edward she is fair and virtuous therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable that only warwicks daughter shall be thine prince edward yes i accept her for she well deserves it and here to pledge my vow i give my hand king lewis xi why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied and thou lord bourbon our high admiral shalt waft them over with our royal fleet i long till edward fall by wars mischance for mocking marriage with a dame of france warwick i came from edward as ambassador but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a stale but me then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow i was the chief that raised him to the crown and ill be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henrys misery but seek revenge on edwards mockery king henry vi gloucester now tell me brother clarence what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey hath not our brother made a worthy choice clarence alas you know tis far from hence to france how could he stay till warwick made return somerset my lords forbear this talk here comes the king gloucester and his wellchosen bride clarence i mind to tell him plainly what i think king edward iv now brother of clarence how like you our choice that you stand pensive as half malcontent clarence as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick which are so weak of courage and in judgment that theyll take no offence at our abuse king edward iv suppose they take offence without a cause they are but lewis and warwick i am edward your king and warwicks and must have my will gloucester and shall have your will because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well king edward iv yea brother richard are you offended too gloucester not i no god forbid that i should wish them severd whom god hath joind together ay and twere pity to sunder them that yoke so well together king edward iv setting your scorns and your mislike aside tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and englands queen and you too somerset and montague speak freely what you think clarence then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona gloucester and warwick doing what you gave in charge is now dishonoured by this new marriage king edward iv what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise montague yet to have joind with france in such alliance would more have strengthend this our commonwealth gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage hastings why knows not montague that of itself england is safe if true within itself montague but the safer when tis backd with france hastings tis better using france than trusting france let us be backd with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable and with their helps only defend ourselves in them and in ourselves our safety lies clarence for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford king edward iv ay what of that it was my will and grant and for this once my will shall stand for law gloucester and yet methinks your grace hath not done well to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood clarence or else you would not have bestowd the heir of the lord bonville on your new wifes son and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere king edward iv alas poor clarence is it for a wife that thou art malcontent i will provide thee clarence in choosing for yourself you showd your judgment which being shallow you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf and to that end i shortly mind to leave you king edward iv leave me or tarry edward will be king and not be tied unto his brothers will queen elizabeth my lords before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen do me but right and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent and meaner than myself have had like fortune but as this title honours me and mine so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow king edward iv my love forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee so long as edward is thy constant friend and their true sovereign whom they must obey nay whom they shall obey and love thee too unless they seek for hatred at my hands which if they do yet will i keep thee safe and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath gloucester king edward iv now messenger what letters or what news from france post my sovereign liege no letters and few words but such as i without your special pardon dare not relate king edward iv go to we pardon thee therefore in brief tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them what answer makes king lewis unto our letters post at my depart these were his very words go tell false edward thy supposed king that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride king edward iv is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry but what said lady bona to my marriage post these were her words utterd with mad disdain tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly ill wear the willow garland for his sake king edward iv i blame not her she could say little less she had the wrong but what said henrys queen for i have heard that she was there in place post tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done and i am ready to put armour on king edward iv belike she minds to play the amazon but what said warwick to these injuries post he more incensed against your majesty than all the rest discharged me with these words tell him from me that he hath done me wrong and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long king edward iv ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words well i will arm me being thus forewarnd they shall have wars and pay for their presumption but say is warwick friends with margaret post ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in friendship that young prince edward marries warwicks daughter clarence belike the elder clarence will have the younger now brother king farewell and sit you fast for i will hence to warwicks other daughter that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself you that love me and warwick follow me gloucester king edward iv clarence and somerset both gone to warwick yet am i armd against the worst can happen and haste is needful in this desperate case pembroke and stafford you in our behalf go levy men and make prepare for war they are already or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you but ere i go hastings and montague resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me if it be so then both depart to him i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience give me assurance with some friendly vow that i may never have you in suspect montague so god help montague as he proves true hastings and hastings as he favours edwards cause king edward iv now brother richard will you stand by us gloucester ay in despite of all that shall withstand you king edward iv why so then am i sure of victory now therefore let us hence and lose no hour till we meet warwick with his foreign power king henry vi warwick trust me my lord all hitherto goes well the common people by numbers swarm to us but see where somerset and clarence come speak suddenly my lords are we all friends clarence fear not that my lord warwick then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick and welcome somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love else might i think that clarence edwards brother were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine and now what rests but in nights coverture thy brother being carelessly encampd his soldiers lurking in the towns about and but attended by a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well coverd with the nights black mantle at unawares may beat down edwards guard and seize himself i say not slaughter him for i intend but only to surprise him you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader why then lets on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends god and saint george king henry vi first watchman come on my masters each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep second watchman what will he not to bed first watchman why no for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppressd second watchman tomorrow then belike shall be the day if warwick be so near as men report third watchman but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent first watchman tis the lord hastings the kings chiefest friend third watchman o is it so but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field second watchman tis the more honour because more dangerous third watchman ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honour if warwick knew in what estate he stands tis to be doubted he would waken him first watchman unless our halberds did shut up his passage second watchman ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent but to defend his person from nightfoes warwick this is his tent and see where stand his guard courage my masters honour now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours first watchman who goes there second watchman stay or thou diest somerset what are they that fly there warwick richard and hastings let them go here is the duke king edward iv the duke why warwick when we parted thou calldst me king warwick ay but the case is alterd when you disgraced me in my embassade then i degraded you from being king and come now to create you duke of york alas how should you govern any kingdom that know not how to use ambassadors nor how to be contented with one wife nor how to use your brothers brotherly nor how to study for the peoples welfare nor how to shroud yourself from enemies king edward iv yea brother of clarence are thou here too nay then i see that edward needs must down yet warwick in despite of all mischance of thee thyself and all thy complices edward will always bear himself as king though fortunes malice overthrow my state my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel warwick then for his mind be edward englands king but henry now shall wear the english crown and be true king indeed thou but the shadow my lord of somerset at my request see that forthwith duke edward be conveyd unto my brother archbishop of york when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows ill follow you and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him now for a while farewell good duke of york king edward iv what fates impose that men must needs abide it boots not to resist both wind and tide oxford what now remains my lords for us to do but march to london with our soldiers warwick ay thats the first thing that we have to do to free king henry from imprisonment and see him seated in the regal throne king henry vi rivers madam what makes you in this sudden change queen elizabeth why brother rivers are you yet to learn what late misfortune is befalln king edward rivers what loss of some pitchd battle against warwick queen elizabeth no but the loss of his own royal person rivers then is my sovereign slain queen elizabeth ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner either betrayd by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares and as i further have to understand is new committed to the bishop of york fell warwicks brother and by that our foe rivers these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may warwick may lose that now hath won the day queen elizabeth till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edwards offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortunes cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edwards fruit true heir to the english crown rivers but madam where is warwick then become queen elizabeth i am informd that he comes towards london to set the crown once more on henrys head guess thou the rest king edwards friends must down but to prevent the tyrants violence for trust not him that hath once broken faith ill hence forthwith unto the sanctuary to save at least the heir of edwards right there shall i rest secure from force and fraud come therefore let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die king henry vi gloucester now my lord hastings and sir william stanley leave off to wonder why i drew you hither into this chiefest thicket of the park thus stands the case you know our king my brother is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty and often but attended with weak guard comes hunting this way to disport himself i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity huntsman this way my lord for this way lies the game king edward iv nay this way man see where the huntsmen stand now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest stand you thus close to steal the bishops deer gloucester brother the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the parkcorner king edward iv but whither shall we then hastings to lynn my lord and ship from thence to flanders gloucester well guessd believe me for that was my meaning king edward iv stanley i will requite thy forwardness gloucester but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk king edward iv huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along huntsman better do so than tarry and be hangd gloucester come then away lets ha no more ado king edward iv bishop farewell shield thee from warwicks frown and pray that i may repossess the crown king henry vi king henry vi master lieutenant now that god and friends have shaken edward from the regal seat and turnd my captive state to liberty my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys at our enlargement what are thy due fees lieutenant subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns but if an humble prayer may prevail i then crave pardon of your majesty king henry vi for what lieutenant for well using me nay be thou sure ill well requite thy kindness for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure ay such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty but warwick after god thou setst me free and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee he was the author thou the instrument therefore that i may conquer fortunes spite by living low where fortune cannot hurt me and that the people of this blessed land may not be punishd with my thwarting stars warwick although my head still wear the crown i here resign my government to thee for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds warwick your grace hath still been famed for virtuous and now may seem as wise as virtuous by spying and avoiding fortunes malice for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace for choosing me when clarence is in place clarence no warwick thou art worthy of the sway to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown as likely to be blest in peace and war and therefore i yield thee my free consent warwick and i choose clarence only for protector king henry vi warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands and with your hands your hearts that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days to sins rebuke and my creators praise warwick what answers clarence to his sovereigns will clarence that he consents if warwick yield consent for on thy fortune i repose myself warwick why then though loath yet must i be content well yoke together like a double shadow to henrys body and supply his place i mean in bearing weight of government while he enjoys the honour and his ease and clarence now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor and all his lands and goods be confiscate clarence what else and that succession be determined warwick ay therein clarence shall not want his part king henry vi but with the first of all your chief affairs let me entreat for i command no more that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for to return from france with speed for till i see them here by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed clarence it shall be done my sovereign with all speed king henry vi my lord of somerset what youth is that of whom you seem to have so tender care somerset my liege it is young henry earl of richmond king henry vi come hither englands hope if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our countrys bliss his looks are full of peaceful majesty his head by nature framed to wear a crown his hand to wield a sceptre and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me warwick what news my friend post that edward is escaped from your brother and fled as he hears since to burgundy warwick unsavoury news but how made he escape post he was conveyd by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishops huntsmen rescued him for hunting was his daily exercise warwick my brother was too careless of his charge but let us hence my sovereign to provide a salve for any sore that may betide somerset my lord i like not of this flight of edwards for doubtless burgundy will yield him help and we shall have more wars before t be long as henrys late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts what may befall him to his harm and ours therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst forthwith well send him hence to brittany till storms be past of civil enmity oxford ay for if edward repossess the crown tis like that richmond with the rest shall down somerset it shall be so he shall to brittany come therefore lets about it speedily king henry vi king edward iv now brother richard lord hastings and the rest yet thus far fortune maketh us amends and says that once more i shall interchange my waned state for

doubt open the gates we are king henrys friends mayor ay say you so the gates shall then be opend gloucester a wise stout captain and soon persuaded hastings the good old man would fain that all were well so twere not long of him but being enterd i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason king edward iv so master mayor these gates must not be shut but in the night or in the time of war what fear not man but yield me up the keys for edward will defend the town and thee and all those friends that deign to follow me gloucester brother this is sir john montgomery our trusty friend unless i be deceived king edward iv welcome sir john but why come you in arms montague to help king edward in his time of storm as every loyal subject ought to do king

warwick what counsel lords edward from belgia with hasty germans and blunt hollanders hath passd in safety through the narrow seas and with his troops doth march amain to london and many giddy people

my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds my mildness hath allayd their swelling griefs my mercy dried their waterflowing tears i have not been desirous of their wealth nor much oppressd them with

clarence come thou wilt if warwick call clarence father of warwick know you what this means look here i throw my infamy at thee i will not ruinate my fathers house who gave his blood to lime the stones together and set up lancaster why trowst thou warwick that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthahs when he sacrificed his daughter i am so sorry for my trespass made that to deserve well at my brothers hands i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe with resolution wheresoeer i meet thee as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad to plague thee for thy foul misleading me and so proudhearted warwick i defy thee and to my brother

now montague sit fast i seek for thee that warwicks bones may keep thine company warwick ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe and tell me who is victor york or warwick why ask i that my mangled body shows my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows that i must yield my body to the earth and by my fall the conquest to my foe thus yields the cedar to the axes edge whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle under whose shade the ramping lion slept whose topbranch overpeerd joves spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winters powerful wind these eyes that now are dimmd with deaths black veil have been as piercing as the midday sun to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood were likend oft to kingly sepulchres for who lived king but i could dig his grave and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow lo now my glory smeard in dust and blood my parks my walks my manors that i had even now forsake me and of all my lands is nothing left me but my bodys length why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust and live we how we can yet die we must somerset ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are we might recover all our loss again the queen from france hath brought a puissant power even now we heard the news ah couldst thou fly warwick why then i would not fly ah montague if thou be there sweet brother take my hand and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak come quickly montague or i am dead somerset ah warwick montague hath breathed his last and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick and said commend me to my valiant brother and more he would have said and more he spoke which sounded like a clamour in a vault that mought not be distinguished but at last i well might hear delivered with a groan o farewell warwick warwick sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven oxford away away to meet the queens great power king henry vi king edward iv thus far our fortune keeps an upward course and we are graced with wreaths of victory but in the midst of this brightshining day i spy a black suspicious threatening cloud that will encounter with our glorious sun ere he attain his easeful western bed i mean my lords those powers that the queen hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast and as we hear march on to fight with us clarence a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came the very beams will dry those vapours up for every cloud engenders not a storm gloucester the queen is valued thirty thousand strong and somerset with oxford fled to her if she have time to breathe be well assured her faction will be full as strong as ours king edward iv we are advertised by our loving friends that they do hold their course toward tewksbury we having now the best at barnet field will thither straight for willingness rids way and as we march our strength will be augmented in every county as we go along strike up the drum cry courage and away king henry vi queen margaret great lords wise men neer sit and wail their loss but cheerly seek how to redress their harms what though the mast be now blown overboard the cable broke the holdinganchor lost and half our sailors swallowd in the flood yet lives our pilot still ist meet that he should leave the helm and like a fearful lad with tearful eyes add water to the sea and give more strength to that which hath too much whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock which industry and courage might have saved ah what a shame ah what a fault were this say warwick was our anchor what of that and montague our topmost what of him our slaughterd friends the tackles what of these why is not oxford here another anchor and somerset another goodly mast the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings and though unskilful why not ned and i for once allowd the skilful pilots charge we will not from the helm to sit and weep but keep our course though the rough wind say no from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck as good to chide the waves as speak them fair and what is edward but ruthless sea what clarence but a quicksand of deceit and richard but a ragged fatal rock all these the enemies to our poor bark say you can swim alas tis but a while tread on the sand why there you quickly sink bestride the rock the tide will wash you off or else you famish thats a threefold death this speak i lords to let you understand if case some one of you would fly from us that theres no hopedfor mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks why courage then what cannot be avoided twere childish weakness to lament or fear prince edward methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should if a coward heard her speak these words infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him naked foil a man at arms i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes lest in our need he might infect another and make him of like spirit to himself if any such be hereas god forbid let him depart before we need his help oxford women and children of so high a courage and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame o brave young prince thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee long mayst thou live to bear his image and renew his glories somerset and he that will not fight for such a hope go home to bed and like the owl

shepherd from the wolf so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece and next his throat unto the butchers knife what scene of death hath roscius now to act gloucester suspicion always haunts the guilty mind the thief doth fear each bush an officer king henry vi the bird that hath been limed in a bush with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush and i the hapless male to one sweet bird have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was limed was caught and killd gloucester why what a peevish fool was that of crete that taught his son the office of a fowl an yet for all his wings the fool was drownd king henry vi i daedalus my poor boy icarus thy father minos that denied our course the sun that seard the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life ah kill me with thy weapon not with words my breast can better brook thy daggers point than can my ears that tragic history but wherefore dost thou come ist for my life gloucester thinkst thou i am an executioner king henry vi a persecutor i am sure thou art if murdering innocents be executing why then thou art an executioner gloucester thy son i killd for his presumption king henry vi hadst thou been killd when first thou didst presume thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine and thus i prophesy that many a thousand which now mistrust no parcel of my fear and many an old mans sigh and many a widows and many an orphans waterstanding eye men for their sons wives for their husbands and orphans for their parents timeless death shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born the owl shriekd at thy birthan evil sign the nightcrow cried aboding luckless time dogs howld and hideous tempest shook down trees the raven rookd her on the chimneys top and chattering pies in dismal discords sung thy mother felt more than a mothers pain and yet brought forth less than a mothers hope to wit an indigested and deformed lump not like the fruit of such a goodly tree teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born to signify thou camest to bite the world and if the rest be true which i have heard thou camest gloucester ill hear no more die prophet in thy speech for this amongst the rest was i ordaind king henry vi ay and for much more slaughter after this god forgive my sins and pardon thee gloucester what will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted see how my sword weeps for the poor kings death o may such purple tears be alway shed from those that wish the downfall of our house if any spark of life be yet remaining down down to hell and say i sent thee thither i that have neither pity love nor fear indeed tis true that henry told me of for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward had i not reason think ye to make haste and seek their ruin that usurpd our right the midwife wonderd and the women cried o jesus bless us he is born with teeth and so i was which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog then since the heavens have shaped my body so let hell make crookd my mind to answer it i have no brother i am like no brother and this word love which graybeards call divine be resident in men like one another and not in me i am myself alone clarence beware thou keepst me from the light but i will sort a pitchy day for thee for i will buz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life and then to purge his fear ill be thy death king henry and the prince his son are gone clarence thy turn is next and then the rest counting myself but bad till i be best ill throw thy body in another room and triumph henry in thy day of doom king henry vi king edward iv once more we sit in englands royal throne repurchased with the blood of enemies what valiant foemen like to autumns corn have we mowd down in tops of all their pride three dukes of somerset threefold renownd for hardy and undoubted champions two cliffords as the father and the son and two northumberlands two braver men neer spurrd their coursers at the trumpets sound with them the two brave bears warwick and montague that in their chains

occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as i have said great difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia camillo i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him archidamus wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed camillo beseech you archidamus verily i speak it in the

camillo sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds the heavens continue their loves archidamus i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note camillo i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man archidamus would they else be content to die camillo yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live archidamus if the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he

nostril where i arrive and my approach be shunnd nay hated too worse than the greatst infection that eer was heard or read camillo swear his thought over by each particular star in heaven and by all their influences you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of his folly whose foundation is piled upon his faith and will continue the standing of his body polixenes how should this grow camillo i know not but i am sure tis safer to avoid whats grown than question how tis born if therefore you dare trust my honesty that lies enclosed in this trunk which you shall bear along impawnd away tonight your followers i will whisper to the business and will by twos and threes at several posterns clear them o the city for myself ill put my fortunes to your service which are here by this discovery lost be not uncertain for by the honour of my parents i have utterd truth which if you seek to prove i dare not stand by nor shall you be

cleomenes the climates delicate the air most sweet fertile the isle the temple much surpassing the common praise it bears dion i shall report for most it caught me the celestial habits methinks i so should term them and the reverence of the grave wearers o the sacrifice how ceremonious solemn and unearthly it was i the offering cleomenes but of all the burst and the eardeafening voice o the oracle kin to joves thunder so surprised my sense that i was nothing dion if the event o the journey prove as successful to the queeno bet so as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy the time is worth the use ont cleomenes great apollo turn all to the best these proclamations so forcing faults upon hermione i little like dion the violent carriage of it will clear or end the business when the oracle thus by apollos great divine seald up shall the contents discover something rare even then will rush to knowledge go fresh horses and gracious be the issue leontes this sessions to our great grief we pronounce even pushes gainst our heart the party tried the daughter of a king our wife and one of us too much beloved let us be cleard of being tyrannous since we so openly proceed in justice which shall have due course even to the guilt or the purgation produce the prisoner officer it is his highness pleasure that the queen appear in person here in court silence leontes read the indictment officer hermione since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me to say not guilty mine integrity being counted falsehood shall as i express it be so received but thus if powers divine behold our human actions as they do i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience you my lord best know who least will seem to do so my past life hath been as continent as chaste as true as i am now unhappy which is more than history can pattern though devised and playd to take spectators for behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe a moiety of the throne a great kings daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honour fore who please to come and hear for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare for honour tis a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for i appeal to your own conscience sir before polixenes came to your court how i was in your grace how merited to be so since he came with what encounter so uncurrent i have straind to appear thus if one jot beyond the bound of honour or in act or will that way inclining hardend be the hearts of all that hear me and my nearst of kin cry fie upon my grave leontes i neer heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first hermione thats true enough through tis a saying sir not due to me leontes you will not own it hermione more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault i must not at all acknowledge for polixenes with whom i am accused i do confess i loved him as in honour he required with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke even since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dishd for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant leontes you knew of his departure as you know what you have undertaen to do ins absence hermione sir you speak a language that i understand not my life stands in the level of your dreams which ill lay down leontes your actions are my dreams you had a bastard by polixenes and i but dreamd it as you were past all shame those of your fact are soso past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails for as thy brat hath been cast out like to itself no father owning itwhich is indeed more criminal in thee than itso thou shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage look for no less than death hermione sir spare your threats the bug which you would fright me with i seek to me can life be no commodity the crown and comfort of my life your favour i do give lost for i do feel it gone but know not how it went my second joy and firstfruits of my body from his presence i am barrd like one infectious my third comfort starrd most unluckily is from my breast the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth haled out to murder myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred

highness fail of issue may drop upon his kingdom and devour incertain lookers on what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well what holier than for royaltys repair for present comfort and for future good to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow tot paulina there is none worthy respecting her thats gone besides the gods will have fulfilld their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said ist not the tenor of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills care not for issue the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to the worthiest so his successor was like to be the best leontes good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honour o that ever i had

first gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be here comes a gentleman that haply knows more the news rogero second gentleman nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it here comes the lady paulinas steward he can deliver you more how goes it now sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir third gentleman most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear youll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle of queen hermiones her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter did you see the meeting of the two kings second gentleman no third gentleman then have you lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it second gentleman what pray you became of antigonus that carried hence the child third gentleman like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherds son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows first gentleman what became of his bark and his followers third gentleman wrecked the same instant of their masters death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found but o the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing first gentleman the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted third gentleman one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the manner how she came tot bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an alas i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world could have seen t the woe had been universal first gentleman are they returned to the court third gentleman no the princess hearing of her mothers statue which is in the keeping of paulinaa piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master julio romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup second gentleman i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing first gentleman who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge lets along autolycus now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but tis all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune shepherd come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born clown you are well met sir you denied to fight with me this other day because i was no gentleman born see you these clothes say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born give me the lie do and try whether i am not now a

father for the kings son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed shepherd we may live son to shed many more clown ay or else twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are autolycus i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master shepherd prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen clown thou wilt amend thy life autolycus ay an it like your good worship clown give me thy hand i will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia shepherd you

it in the behalf of his friend and ill swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but ill swear it and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands autolycus i will prove so sir to my power clown ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder how thou darest

the statue of our queen your gallery have we passd through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother paulina as

mockd as ever still sleep mockd death behold and say tis well i like your silence it the more shows off your wonder but yet speak first you my liege comes it not something near leontes her natural posture chide me dear stone that i may say indeed thou art hermione or rather thou art she in thy not chiding for she was as tender as infancy and grace but yet paulina hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing so aged as this seems polixenes o not by much paulina so much the more our carvers excellence which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now leontes as now she might have done so much to my good comfort as it is now piercing to my soul o thus she stood even with such life of majesty warm life as now it coldly stands when first i wood her i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it o royal piece theres magic in thy majesty which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits standing like stone with thee perdita and give me leave and do not say tis superstition that i kneel and then implore her blessing lady dear queen that ended when i but began give me that hand of yours to kiss paulina o patience the statue is but newly fixd the colours not dry camillo my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on which sixteen winters cannot blow away so many summers dry scarce any joy did ever

did verily bear blood polixenes masterly done the very life seems warm upon her lip leontes the fixture of her eye has motion int as we are mockd with art paulina ill draw the curtain my lords almost so far transported that hell think anon it lives leontes o sweet paulina make me to think so twenty years together no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness let t alone paulina i am sorry sir i have thus far stirrd you but i could afflict you farther leontes do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort still methinks there is an air comes from her what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me for i will kiss her paulina good my lord forbear the ruddiness upon her lip is wet youll mar it if you kiss it stain your own with oily painting shall i draw the curtain leontes no not these twenty years perdita so long could i stand by a looker on paulina either forbear quit presently the chapel or resolve you for more amazement if you can behold it ill make the statue move indeed descend and take you by the hand but then youll think which i protest againsti am assisted by wicked powers leontes what you can make her do i am content to look on what to speak i am content to hear for tis as easy to make her speak as move paulina it is required you do awake your faith then all stand still on those that think it is unlawful business i am about let them depart leontes proceed no foot shall stir paulina music awake her strike tis time descend be stone no more approach strike all that look upon with marvel come ill

madam kneel and pray your mothers blessing turn good lady our perdita is found hermione you gods look down and from your sacred vials pour your graces upon my daughters head tell me mine own where hast thou been preserved where lived how found thy fathers court for thou shalt hear that i knowing by paulina that the oracle gave hope thou wast in being have preserved myself to see the issue paulina theres time enough for that lest they desire upon this push to trouble your joys with like relation go together you precious winners all your exultation partake to every one i an old turtle will wing me to some witherd bough and there my mate thats never to be found again lament till i am lost leontes o peace paulina thou shouldst a husband take by my consent as i by thine a wife this is

upon my brother both your pardons that eer i put between your holy looks my ill suspicion this is your soninlaw and son unto the king who heavens directing is trothplight to your daughter good paulina lead us from hence where we may leisurely each one demand an answer to his part performd in this wide gap of time since first we were disseverd hastily lead away duke vincentio escalus escalus my lord duke vincentio of government the properties to unfold would seem in me to affect speech and discourse since i am put to know that your own science exceeds in that the lists of all advice my strength can give you then no more remains but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able and let them work the nature of our people our citys institutions and the terms for common justice youre as pregnant in as art and practise hath enriched any that we remember there is our commission from which we would not have you warp call hither i say bid come before us angelo what figure of us think you he will bear for you must know we have with special soul elected him our absence to supply lent him our terror dressd him with our love and given his deputation all the organs of our own power what think you of it escalus if any in vienna be of worth to undergo such ample grace and honour it is lord angelo duke vincentio look where he comes angelo always obedient to your graces will i come to know your pleasure duke vincentio angelo there is a kind of character in thy life that to the observer doth thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues they on thee heaven doth with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us twere all alike as if we had them not spirits are not finely touchd but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use but i do bend my speech to one that can my part in him advertise hold therefore angelo in our remove be thou at full ourself mortality and mercy in vienna live in thy tongue and heart old escalus though first in question is thy secondary take thy commission angelo now good my lord let there be some more test made of my metal before so noble and so great a figure be stampd upon it duke vincentio no more evasion we have with a leavend and prepared choice proceeded to you therefore take your honours our haste from hence is of so quick condition that it prefers itself and leaves unquestiond matters of needful value we shall write to you as time and our concernings shall importune how it goes with us and do look to know what doth befall you here so fare you well to the hopeful execution do i leave you of your commissions angelo yet give leave my lord that we may bring you something on the way duke vincentio my haste may not admit it nor need you on mine honour have to do with any scruple your scope is as mine own so to enforce or qualify the laws as to your soul seems good give me your hand ill privily away i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes through it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it once more fare you well angelo the heavens give safety to your purposes escalus lead forth and bring you back in happiness duke i thank you fare you well escalus i shall desire you sir to give me leave to have free speech with you and it concerns me to look into the bottom of my place a power i have but of what strength and nature i am not yet instructed angelo tis so with me let us withdraw together and we may soon our satisfaction have touching that point escalus ill wait upon your honour lucio if the duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the king of hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the king first gentleman heaven grant us its peace but not the king of hungarys second gentleman amen lucio thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped one out of the table second gentleman thou shalt not steal lucio ay that he razed first gentleman why twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal theres not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace second gentleman i never heard any soldier dislike it lucio i believe thee for i think thou never wast where grace was said second gentleman no a dozen times at least first gentleman what in metre lucio in any proportion or in any language first gentleman i think or in any religion lucio ay why not grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace first gentleman well there went but a pair of shears between us lucio i grant as there may between the lists and the velvet thou art the list first gentleman and thou the velvet thou art good velvet thourt a threepiled piece i warrant thee i had as lief be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou art piled for a french velvet do i speak feelingly now lucio i think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech i will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i live forget to drink after thee first gentleman i think i have done myself wrong have i not second gentleman yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free lucio behold behold where madam mitigation comes i have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to second gentleman to what i pray lucio judge second gentleman to three thousand dolours a year first gentleman ay and more lucio a french crown more first gentleman thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error i am sound lucio nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee first gentleman how now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica mistress overdone well well theres one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all second gentleman whos that i pray thee mistress overdone marry sir thats claudio signior claudio first gentleman claudio to prison tis not so mistress overdone nay but i know tis so i saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopped off lucio but after all this fooling i would not have it so art thou sure of this mistress overdone i am too sure of it and it is for getting madam julietta with child lucio believe me this may be he promised to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promisekeeping second gentleman besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose first gentleman but most of all agreeing with the proclamation lucio away lets go learn the truth of it mistress overdone thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty i am customshrunk how now whats the news with you pompey yonder man is carried to prison mistress overdone well what has he done pompey a woman mistress overdone but whats his offence pompey groping for trouts in a peculiar river mistress overdone what is there a maid with child by him pompey no but theres a woman with maid by him you have not heard of the proclamation have you mistress overdone what proclamation man pompey all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down mistress overdone and what shall become of those in the city pompey they shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them mistress overdone but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down pompey to the ground mistress mistress overdone why heres a change indeed in the commonwealth what shall become of me pompey come fear you not good counsellors lack no clients though you change your place you need not change your trade ill be your tapster still courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered mistress overdone whats to do here thomas tapster lets withdraw pompey here comes signior claudio led by the provost to prison and theres madam juliet claudio fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world bear me to prison where i am committed provost i do it not in evil disposition but from lord angelo by special charge claudio thus can the demigod authority make us pay down for our offence by weight the words of heaven on whom it will it will on whom it will not so yet still tis just lucio why how now claudio whence comes this restraint claudio from too much liberty my lucio liberty as surfeit is the father of much fast so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint our natures do pursue like rats that ravin down their proper bane a thirsty evil and when we drink we die lucio if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment whats thy offence claudio claudio what but to speak of would offend again lucio what ist murder claudio no lucio lechery claudio call it so provost away sir you must go claudio one word good friend lucio a word with you lucio a hundred if theyll do you any good is lechery so lookd after claudio thus stands it with me upon a true contract i got possession of juliettas bed you know the lady she is fast my wife save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order this we came not to only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet lucio with child perhaps claudio unhappily even so and the new deputy now for the duke whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness or whether that the body public be a horse whereon the governor doth ride who newly in the seat that it may know he can command lets it straight feel the spur whether the tyranny be in his place or in his emmence that fills it up i stagger inbut this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have like unscourd armour hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn and for a name now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me tis surely for a name lucio i warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to him claudio i have done so but hes not to be found i prithee lucio do me this kind service this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect such as move men beside she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse and well she can persuade lucio i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of ticktack ill to her claudio i thank you good friend lucio lucio within two hours claudio come officer away duke vincentio no holy father throw away that thought believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee to give me secret harbour hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth friar thomas may your grace speak of it duke vincentio my holy sir none better knows than you how i have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps i have deliverd to lord angelo a man of stricture and firm abstinence my absolute power and place here in vienna and he supposes me travelld to poland for so i have strewd it in the common ear and so it is received now pious sir you will demand of me why i do this friar thomas gladly my lord duke vincentio we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds which for this nineteen years we have let slip even like an oergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their childrens sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum friar thomas it rested in your grace to unloose this tiedup justice when you pleased and it in you more dreadful would have seemd than in lord angelo duke vincentio i do fear too dreadful sith twas my fault to give the people scope twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what i bid them do for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment therefore indeed my father i have on angelo imposed the office who may in the ambush of my name strike home and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander and to behold his sway i will as twere a brother of your order visit both prince and people therefore i prithee supply me with the habit and instruct me how i may formally in person bear me like a true friar more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall i render you only this one lord angelo is precise stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses that his blood flows or that his appetite is more to bread than stone hence shall we see if power change purpose what our seemers be isabella and have you nuns no farther privileges francisca are not these large enough isabella yes truly i speak not as desiring more but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare lucio isabella whos that which calls francisca it is a mans voice gentle isabella turn you the key and know his business of him you may i may not you are yet unsworn when you have vowd you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress then if you speak you must not show your face or if you show your face you must not speak he calls again i pray you answer him isabella peace and prosperity who ist that calls lucio hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses proclaim you are no less can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella a novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio isabella why her unhappy brother let me ask the rather for i now must make you know i am that isabella and his sister lucio gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you not to be weary with you hes in prison isabella woe me for what lucio for that which if myself might be his judge he should receive his punishment in thanks he hath got his friend with child isabella sir make me not your story lucio it is true i would notthough tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest tongue far from heartplay with all virgins so i hold you as a thing enskyd and sainted by your renouncement an immortal spirit and to be talkd with in sincerity as with a saint isabella you do blaspheme the good in mocking me lucio do not believe it fewness and truth tis thus your brother and his lover have embraced as those that feed grow full as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry isabella some one with child by him my cousin juliet lucio is she your cousin isabella adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names by vain though apt affection lucio she it is isabella o let him marry her lucio this is the point the duke is very strangely gone from hence bore many gentlemen myself being one in hand and hope of action but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state his givingsout were of an infinite distance from his truemeant design upon his place and with full line of his authority governs lord angelo a man whose blood is very snowbroth one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind study and fast heto give fear to use and liberty which have for long run by the hideous law as mice by lionshath pickd out an act under whose heavy sense your brothers life falls into forfeit he arrests him on it and follows close the rigour of the statute to make him an example all hope is gone unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo and thats my pith of business twixt you and your poor brother isabella doth he so seek his life lucio has censured him already and as i hear the provost hath a warrant for his execution isabella alas what poor abilitys in me to do him good lucio assay the power you have isabella my power alas i doubt lucio our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens sue men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them isabella ill see what i can do lucio but speedily isabella i will about it straight no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair i humbly thank you commend me to my brother soon at night ill send him certain word of my success lucio i take my leave of you isabella good sir adieu angelo we must not make a scarecrow of the law setting it up to fear the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom make it their perch and not their terror escalus ay but yet let us be keen and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to death alas this gentleman whom i would save had a most noble father let but your honour know whom i believe to be most strait in virtue that in the working of your own affections had time cohered with place or place with wishing or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attaind the effect of your own purpose whether you had not sometime in your life errd in this point which now you censure him and pulld the law upon you angelo tis one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall i not deny the jury passing on the prisoners life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try whats open made to justice that justice seizes what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and taket because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it you may not so extenuate his offence for i have had such faults but rather tell me when i that censure him do so offend let mine own judgment pattern out my death and nothing come in partial sir he must die escalus be it as your wisdom will angelo where is the provost provost here if it like your honour angelo see that claudio be executed by nine tomorrow morning bring him his confessor let him be prepared for thats the utmost of his pilgrimage escalus elbow come bring them away if these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses i know no law bring them away angelo how now sir whats your name and whats the matter elbow if it please your honour i am

would angelo look what i will not that i cannot do isabella but might you dot and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touchd with that remorse as mine is to him angelo hes sentenced tis too late lucio isabella too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the kings crown nor the deputed sword the marshals truncheon nor the judges robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipt like him but he like you would not have been so stern angelo pray you be gone isabella i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel should it then be thus no i would tell what twere to be a judge and what a prisoner lucio angelo your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words isabella alas alas why all the souls that were were forfeit once and he that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are o think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made angelo be you content fair maid it is the law not i condemn your brother were he my kinsman brother or my son it should be thus with him he must die tomorrow isabella tomorrow o thats sudden spare him spare him hes not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that hath died for this offence theres many have committed it lucio angelo the law hath not been dead though it hath slept those many had not dared to do that evil if the first that did the edict infringe had answerd for his deed now tis awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils either new or by remissness newconceived and so in progress to be hatchd and born are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end isabella yet show some pity angelo i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismissd offence would after gall and do him right that answering one foul wrong lives not to act another be satisfied your brother dies tomorrow be content isabella so you must be the first that gives this sentence and he that suffers o it is excellent to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant lucio isabella could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would neer be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt splitst the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle but man proud man drest in a little brief authority most ignorant of what hes most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal lucio provost isabella we cannot weigh our brother with ourself great men may jest with saints tis wit in them but in the less foul profanation lucio thourt i the right girl more o that isabella that in the captains but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy lucio angelo why do you put these sayings upon me isabella because authority though it err like others hath yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it doth know thats like my brothers fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brothers life angelo isabella gentle my lord turn back angelo i will bethink me come again tomorrow isabella hark how ill bribe you good my lord turn back angelo how bribe me isabella ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you lucio isabella not with fond shekels of the tested gold or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate to nothing temporal angelo well come to me tomorrow lucio isabella heaven keep your honour safe angelo isabella at what hour tomorrow shall i attend your lordship angelo at any time fore noon isabella save your honour angelo from thee even from thy virtue whats this whats this is this her fault or mine the tempter or the tempted who sins most ha not she nor doth she tempt but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than womans lightness having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie what dost thou or what art thou angelo dost thou desire her foully for those things that make her good o let her brother live thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what ist i dream on o cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigour art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite even till now when men were fond i smiled and wonderd how duke vincentio hail to you provost so i think you are provost i am the provost whats your will good friar duke vincentio bound by my charity and my blest order i come to visit the afflicted spirits here in the prison do me the common right to let me see them and to make me know the nature of their crimes that i may minister to them accordingly provost i would do more than that if more were needful look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine who falling in the flaws of her own youth hath blisterd her report she is with child and he that got it sentenced a young man more fit to do another such offence than die for this duke vincentio when must he die provost as i do think tomorrow i have provided for you stay awhile and you shall be conducted duke vincentio repent you fair one of the sin you carry juliet i do and bear the shame most patiently duke vincentio ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be sound or hollowly put on juliet ill gladly learn duke vincentio love you the man that wrongd you juliet yes as i love the woman that wrongd him duke vincentio so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed juliet mutually duke vincentio then was your sin of heavier kind than his juliet i do confess it and repent it father duke vincentio tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent as that the sin hath brought you to this shame which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven showing we would not spare heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear juliet i do repent me as it is an evil and take the shame with joy duke vincentio there rest your partner as i hear must die tomorrow and i am going with instruction to him grace go with you benedicite juliet must die tomorrow o injurious love that respites me a life whose very comfort is still a dying horror provost tis pity of him angelo when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven hath my empty words whilst my invention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel heaven in my mouth as if i did but only chew his name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown feard and tedious yea my gravity whereinlet no man hear mei take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain o place o form how often dost thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art blood lets write good angel on the devils horn tis not the devils crest how now whos there servant one isabel a sister desires access to you angelo teach her the way o heavens why does my blood thus muster to my heart making both it unable for itself and dispossessing all my other parts of necessary fitness so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons come all to help him and so stop the air by which he should revive and even so the general subject to a wellwishd king quit their own part and in obsequious fondness crowd to his presence where their untaught love must needs appear offence how now fair maid isabella i am come to know your pleasure angelo that you might know it would much better please me than to demand what tis your brother cannot live isabella even so heaven keep your honour angelo yet may he live awhile and it may be as long as you or i yet he must die isabella under your sentence angelo yea isabella when i beseech you that in his reprieve longer or shorter he may be so fitted that his soul sicken not angelo ha fie these filthy vices it were as good to pardon him that hath from nature stolen a man already made as to remit their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image in stamps that are forbid tis all as easy falsely to take away a life true made as to put metal in restrained means to make a false one isabella tis set down so in heaven but not in earth angelo say you so then i shall pose you quickly which had you rather that the most just law now took your brothers life or to redeem him give up your body to such sweet uncleanness as she that he hath staind isabella sir believe this i had rather give my body than my soul angelo i talk not of your soul our compelld sins stand more for number than for accompt isabella how say you angelo nay ill not warrant that for i can speak against the thing i say answer to this i now the voice of the recorded law pronounce a sentence on your brothers life might there not be a charity in sin to save this brothers life isabella please you to dot ill take it as a peril to my soul it is no sin at all but charity angelo pleased you to dot at peril of your soul were equal poise of sin and charity isabella that i do beg his life if it be sin heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit if that be sin ill make it my morn prayer to have it added to the faults of mine and nothing of your answer angelo nay but hear me your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant or seem so craftily and thats not good isabella let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better angelo thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright when it doth tax itself as these black masks proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder than beauty could displayd but mark me to be received plain ill speak more gross your brother is to die isabella so angelo and his offence is so as it appears accountant to the law upon that pain isabella true angelo admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss of questionthat you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the allbuilding law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else to let him suffer what would you do isabella as much for my poor brother as myself that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips ild wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing have been sick for ere ild yield my body up to shame angelo then must your brother die isabella and twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died at once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slanderd so isabella ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption angelo you seemd of late to make the law a tyrant and rather proved the sliding of your brother a merriment than a vice isabella o pardon me my lord it oft falls out to have what we would have we speak not what we mean i something do excuse the thing i hate for his advantage that i dearly love angelo we are all frail isabella else let my brother die if not a feodary but only he owe and succeed thy weakness angelo nay women are frail too isabella ay as the glasses where they view themselves which are as easy broke as they make forms women help heaven men their creation mar in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail for we are soft as our complexions are and credulous to false prints angelo i think it well and from this testimony of your own sex since i suppose we are made to be no stronger than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold i do arrest your words be that you are that is a woman if you be more youre none if you be one as you are well expressd by all external warrants show it now by putting on the destined livery isabella i have no tongue but one gentle my lord let me entreat you speak the former language angelo plainly conceive i love you isabella my brother did love juliet and you tell me that he shall die for it angelo he shall not isabel if you give me love isabella i know your virtue hath a licence int which seems a little fouler than it is to pluck on others angelo believe me on mine honour my words express my purpose isabella ha little honour to be much believed and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming i will proclaim thee angelo look fort sign me a present pardon for my brother or with an outstretchd throat ill tell the world aloud what man thou art angelo who will believe thee isabel my unsoild name the austereness of my life my vouch against you and my place i the state will so your accusation overweigh that you shall stifle in your own report and smell of calumny i have begun and now i give my sensual race the rein fit thy consent to my sharp appetite lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother by yielding up thy body to my will or else he must not only die the death but thy unkindness shall his death draw out to lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow or by the affection that now guides me most ill prove a tyrant to him as for you say what you can my false oerweighs your true isabella to whom should i complain did i tell this who would believe me o perilous mouths that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue either of condemnation or approof bidding the law make courtsy to their will hooking both right and wrong to the appetite to follow as it draws ill to my brother though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood yet hath he in him such a mind of honour that had he twenty heads to tender down on twenty bloody blocks held yield them up before his sister should her body stoop to such abhorrd pollution then isabel live chaste and brother die more than our brother is our chastity ill tell him yet of angelos request and fit his mind to death for his souls rest duke vincentio so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo claudio the miserable have no other medicine but only hope ive hope to live and am prepared to die duke vincentio be absolute for death either death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skyey influences that dost this habitation where thou keepst hourly afflict merely thou art deaths fool for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun and yet runnst toward him still thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou bearst are nursed by baseness thourt by no means valiant for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fearst thy death which is no more thou art not thyself for thou existst on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forgetst thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects after the moon if thou art rich thourt poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bears thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloads thee friend hast thou none for thine own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age but as it were an afterdinners sleep dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth becomes as aged and doth beg the alms of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty to make thy riches pleasant whats yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even claudio i humbly thank you to sue to live i find i seek to die and seeking death find life let it come on isabella provost whos there come in the wish deserves a welcome duke vincentio dear sir ere long ill visit you again claudio most holy sir i thank you isabella my business is a word or two with claudio provost and very welcome look signior heres your sister duke vincentio provost a word with you provost as many as you please duke vincentio bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed claudio now sister whats the comfort isabella why as all comforts are most good most good indeed lord angelo having affairs to heaven intends you for his swift ambassador where you shall be an everlasting leiger therefore your best appointment make with speed tomorrow you set on claudio is there no remedy isabella none but such remedy as to save a head to cleave a heart in twain claudio but is there any isabella yes brother you may live there is a devilish mercy in the judge if youll implore it that will free your life but fetter you till death claudio perpetual durance isabella ay just perpetual durance a restraint though all the worlds vastidity you had to a determined scope claudio but in what nature isabella in such a one as you consenting tot would bark your honour from that trunk you bear and leave you naked claudio let me know the point isabella o i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honour darest thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies claudio why give you me this shame think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in mine arms isabella there spake my brother there my fathers grave did utter forth a voice yes thou must die thou art too noble to conserve a life in base appliances this outwardsainted deputy whose settled visage and deliberate word nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil his filth within being cast he would appear a pond as deep as hell claudio the prenzie angelo isabella o tis the cunning livery of hell the damnedst body to invest and cover in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio if i would yield him my virginity thou mightst be freed claudio o heavens it cannot be isabella yes he would givet thee from this rank offence so to offend him still this nights the time that i should do what i abhor to name or else thou diest tomorrow claudio thou shalt not dot isabella o were it but my life ild throw it down for your deliverance as frankly as a pin claudio thanks dear isabel isabella be ready claudio for your death tomorrow claudio yes has he affections in him that thus can make him bite the law by the nose when he would force it sure it is no sin or of the deadly seven it is the least isabella which is the least claudio if it were damnable he being so wise why would he for the momentary trick be perdurably fined o isabel isabella what says my brother claudio death is a fearful thing isabella and shamed life a hateful claudio ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling region of thickribbed ice to be imprisond in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling tis too horrible the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ache penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death isabella alas alas claudio sweet sister let me live what sin you do to save a brothers life nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue isabella o you beast o faithless coward o dishonest wretch wilt thou be made a man out of my vice ist not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sisters shame what should i think heaven shield my mother playd my father fair for such a warped slip of wilderness neer issued from his blood take my defiance die perish might but my bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death no word to save thee claudio nay hear me isabel isabella o fie fie fie thy sins not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd tis best thou diest quickly claudio o hear me isabella duke vincentio vouchsafe a word young sister but one word isabella what is your will duke vincentio might you dispense with your leisure i would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction i would require is likewise your own benefit isabella i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile duke vincentio son i have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures she having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible tomorrow you must die go to your knees and make ready claudio let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love with life that i will sue to be rid of it duke vincentio hold you there farewell provost a word with you provost whats your will father duke vincentio that now you are come you will be gone leave me awhile with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company provost in good time duke vincentio the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair the assault that angelo hath made to you fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling i should wonder at angelo how will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother isabella i am now going to resolve him i had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can speak to him i will open my lips in vain or discover his government duke vincentio that shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love i have in doing good a remedy presents itself i do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business isabella let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit duke vincentio virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have you not heard speak of mariana the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea isabella i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name duke vincentio she should this angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriagedowry with both her combinate husband this wellseeming angelo isabella can this be so did angelo so leave her duke vincentio left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not isabella what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world what corruption in this life that it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail duke vincentio it is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it isabella show me how good father duke vincentio this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience this being granted in courseand now follows allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof what think you of it isabella the image of it gives me content already and i trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection duke vincentio it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily to angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction i will presently to saint lukes there at the moated grange resides this dejected mariana at that place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that it may be quickly isabella i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father elbow nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard duke vincentio o heavens what stuff is here pompey twas never merry

but where is he think you duke vincentio i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well lucio it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to t duke vincentio he does well in t lucio a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar duke vincentio it is too general a vice and severity must cure it lucio yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation is it true think you duke vincentio how should he be made then lucio some report a seamaid spawned him some that he was begot between two stockfishes but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice that i know to be true and he is a motion generative thats infallible duke vincentio you are pleasant sir and speak apace lucio why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man would the duke that is absent have done this ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand he had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy duke vincentio i never heard the absent duke much detected for women he was not inclined that way lucio o sir you are deceived duke vincentio tis not possible lucio who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clackdish the duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too that let me inform you duke vincentio you do him wrong surely lucio sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the duke and i believe i know the cause of his withdrawing duke vincentio what i prithee might be the cause lucio no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips but this i can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise duke vincentio wise why no question but he was lucio a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow duke vincentio either this is the envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own bringingsforth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice lucio sir i know him and i love him duke vincentio love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love lucio come sir i know what i know duke vincentio i can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak but if ever the duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him if it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it i am bound to call upon you and i pray you your name lucio sir my name is lucio well known to the duke duke vincentio he shall know you better sir if i may live to report you lucio i fear you not duke vincentio o you hope the duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i can do you little harm youll forswear this again lucio ill be hanged first thou art deceived in me friar but no more of this canst thou tell if claudio die tomorrow or no duke vincentio why should he die sir lucio why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would the duke we talk of were returned again the ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his houseeaves because they are lecherous the duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light would he were returned marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing farewell good friar i prithee pray for me the duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on fridays hes not past it yet and i say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic say that i said so farewell duke vincentio no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape backwounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue but who comes here escalus go away with her to prison mistress overdone good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lord escalus double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind this would make mercy swear and play the tyrant provost a bawd of eleven years continuance may it please your honour mistress overdone my lord this is one lucios information against me mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the dukes time he promised her marriage his child is a year and a quarter old come philip and jacob i have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me escalus that fellow is a fellow of much licence let him be called before us away with her to prison go to no more words provost my brother angelo will not be altered claudio must die tomorrow let him be furnished with divines and

order late come from the see in special business from his holiness escalus what news abroad i the world duke vincentio none but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this news is old enough yet it is every days news i pray you sir of what disposition was the duke escalus one that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself duke vincentio what pleasure was he given to escalus rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at any thing which professed to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find claudio prepared i am made to understand that you have lent him visitation duke vincentio he professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which i by my good leisure have discredited to him and now is he resolved to die escalus you have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling i have laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have i found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him he is indeed justice duke vincentio if his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenced himself escalus i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well duke vincentio peace be with you he who the sword of heaven will bear should be as holy as severe pattern in himself to know grace to stand and virtue go more nor less to others paying than by selfoffences weighing shame to him whose cruel striking kills for faults of his own liking twice treble shame on angelo to weed my vice and let his grow o what may man within him hide though angel on the outward side how may likeness made in crimes making practise on the times to draw with idle spiders strings most ponderous and substantial things craft against vice i must apply with angelo tonight shall lie his old betrothed but despised so disguise shall by the disguised pay with falsehood false exacting and perform an old

vincentio they will then eret be long provost what comfort is for claudio duke vincentio theres some in hope provost it is a bitter deputy duke vincentio not so not so his life is paralleld even with the stroke and line of his great justice he doth with holy abstinence subdue that in himself which he spurs on his power to qualify in others were he meald with that which he corrects then were he tyrannous but this being so hes just now are they come this is a gentle provost seldom when the steeled gaoler is the friend of men how now what noise that spirits possessed with haste that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes provost there he must stay until the officer arise to let him in he is calld up duke vincentio have you no countermand for claudio yet but he must die tomorrow provost none sir none duke vincentio as near the dawning provost as it is you shall hear more ere morning provost happily you something know yet i believe there comes no countermand no such example have we besides upon the very siege of justice lord angelo hath to the public ear professd the contrary this is his lordships man duke vincentio and here comes claudios pardon messenger provost i shall obey him duke vincentio provost i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before duke vincentio pray you lets hear provost duke vincentio what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon provost a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one that is a prisoner nine years old duke vincentio how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him i have heard it was ever his manner to do so provost his friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of lord angelo came not to an undoubtful proof duke vincentio it is now apparent provost most manifest and not denied by himself duke vincentio hath he born himself penitently in prison how seems he to be touched provost a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of whats past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal duke vincentio he wants advice provost he will hear none he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all duke vincentio more of him anon there is written in your brow provost honesty and constancy if i read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him to make you understand this in a manifested effect i crave but four days respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy provost pray sir in what duke vincentio in the delaying death provost a lack how may i do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of angelo i may make my case as claudios to cross this in the smallest duke vincentio by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my instructions may be your guide let this barnardine be this morning executed and his head born to angelo provost angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour duke vincentio o deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death you know the course is common if any thing fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead against it with my life provost pardon me good father it is against my oath duke vincentio were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy provost to him and to his substitutes duke vincentio you will think you have made no offence if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing provost but what likelihood is in that duke vincentio not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you look you sir here is the hand and seal of the duke you know the character i doubt not and the signet is not strange to you provost i know them both duke vincentio the contents of this is the return of the duke you shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor perchance of the dukes death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ look the unfolding star calls up the shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known call your executioner and off with barnardines head i will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place yet you are amazed

nor hurts him nor profits you a jot forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven mark what i say which you shall find by every syllable a faithful verity the duke comes home tomorrow nay dry your eyes one of our convent and his confessor gives me this instance already he hath carried notice to escalus and angelo who do prepare to meet him at the gates there to give up their power if you can pace your wisdom in that good path that i would wish it go and you shall have your bosom on this wretch grace of the duke revenges to your heart and general honour isabella i am directed by you duke vincentio this letter then to friar peter give tis that he sent me of the dukes return say by this token i desire his company at marianas house tonight her cause and yours ill perfect him withal and

fretting waters from your eyes with a light heart trust not my holy order if i pervert your course whos here lucio good even friar wheres the provost duke vincentio not within sir lucio o pretty isabella i am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red thou must be patient i am fain to dine and sup with water and bran i dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to t but they say the duke will be here tomorrow by my troth isabel i loved thy brother if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived duke vincentio sir the duke is marvellous

answer this one day fare ye well lucio nay tarry ill go along with thee i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke duke vincentio you have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enough lucio i was once before him for getting a wench with child duke vincentio did you such a thing lucio yes marry did i but i was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar duke vincentio sir your company is fairer than honest rest you well lucio by my troth ill go with thee to the lanes end if bawdy talk offend you well have very little of it nay friar i am a kind of burr i shall stick escalus every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other angelo in most uneven and distracted manner his actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted and why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there escalus i guess not angelo and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his entering that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street escalus he shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which shall then have no power to stand against us angelo well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes i the morn ill call you at your house give notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet him escalus i shall sir fare you well angelo good night this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant and dull to all proceedings a deflowerd maid and by an eminent body that enforced the law against it but that her tender shame will not proclaim against her maiden loss how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no for my authority bears of a credent bulk that no particular scandal once can touch but it confounds the breather he should have lived save that riotous youth with dangerous sense might in the times to come have taen revenge by so receiving a dishonourd life with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived a lack when once our grace we have forgot nothing goes right we would and we would not duke vincentio these letters at fit time deliver me the provost knows our purpose and our plot the matter being afoot keep your instruction and hold you ever to our special drift though sometimes you do blench from this to that as cause doth minister go call at flavius house and tell him where i stay give the like notice to valentinus rowland and to crassus and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate but send me flavius first friar peter it shall be speeded well duke vincentio i thank thee varrius thou hast made good haste come we will walk theres other of our friends will greet us here anon my gentle varrius isabella to speak so indirectly i am loath i would say the truth but to accuse him so that is your part yet i am advised to do it he says to veil full purpose mariana be ruled by him isabella besides he tells me that if peradventure he speak against me on the adverse side i should not think it strange for tis a physic thats bitter to sweet end mariana i would friar peter isabella o peace the friar is come friar peter come i have found you out a stand most fit where you may have such vantage on the duke he shall not pass you twice have the trumpets sounded the generous and gravest citizens have hent the gates and very near upon the duke is entering therefore hence away duke vincentio my very worthy cousin fairly met our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you angelo happy return be to your royal grace duke vincentio many and hearty thankings to you both we have made inquiry of you and we hear such goodness of your justice that our soul cannot but yield you forth to public thanks forerunning more requital angelo you make my bonds still greater duke vincentio o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it to lock it in the wards of covert bosom when it deserves with characters of brass a forted residence gainst the tooth of time and razure of oblivion give me your hand and let the subject see to make them know that outward courtesies would fain proclaim favours that keep within come escalus you must walk by us on our other hand and good supporters are you friar peter now is your time speak loud and kneel before him isabella justice o royal duke vail your regard upon a wrongd i would fain have said a maid o worthy prince dishonour not your eye by throwing it on any other object till you have heard me in my true complaint and given me justice justice justice justice duke vincentio relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief here is lord angelo shall give you justice reveal yourself to him isabella o worthy duke you bid me seek redemption of the devil hear me yourself for that which i must speak must either punish me not being believed or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here angelo my lord her wits i fear me are not firm she hath been a suitor to me for her brother cut off by course of justice isabella by course of justice angelo and she will speak most bitterly and strange isabella most strange but yet most truly will i speak that angelos forsworn is it not strange that angelos a murderer is t not strange that angelo is an adulterous thief an hypocrite a virginviolator is it not strange and strange duke vincentio nay it is ten times strange isabella it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange nay it is ten times true for truth is truth to the end of reckoning duke vincentio away with her poor soul she speaks this in the infirmity of sense isabella o prince i conjure thee as thou believest there is another comfort than this world that thou neglect me not with that opinion that i am touchd with madness make not impossible that which but seems unlike tis not impossible but one the wickedst caitiff on the ground may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute as angelo even so may angelo in all his dressings characts titles forms be an archvillain believe it royal prince if he be less hes nothing but hes more had i more name for badness duke vincentio by mine honesty if she be madas i believe no other her madness hath the oddest frame of sense such a dependency of thing on thing as eer i heard in madness isabella o gracious duke harp not on that nor do not banish reason for inequality but let your reason serve to make the truth appear where it seems hid and hide the false seems true duke vincentio many that are not mad have sure more lack of reason what would you say isabella i am the sister of one claudio condemnd upon the act of fornication to lose his head condemnd by angelo i in probation of a sisterhood was sent to by my brother one lucio as then the messenger lucio thats i ant like your grace i came to her from claudio and desired her to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo for her poor brothers pardon isabella thats he indeed duke vincentio you were not bid to speak lucio no my good lord nor wishd to hold my peace duke vincentio i wish you now then pray you take note of it and when you have a business for yourself pray heaven you then be perfect lucio i warrant your honour duke vincentio the warrants for yourself take heed tot

townarmory with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten nearlegged before and with a halfchequed bit and a headstall of sheeps leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six time pieced and a womans crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there pieced with packthread baptista who comes with him biondello o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies pricked int for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian footboy or a gentlemans lackey tranio tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion yet oftentimes

katharina fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable a woman moved is like a fountain troubled muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts come come you froward and unable worms my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but

ends all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which but by being so retired oerprized all popular rate in my false brother awaked an evil nature and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having into truth by telling of it made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke out o the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing dost thou hear miranda your tale sir would cure deafness prospero to have no screen between this part he playd and him he playd it for he needs will be absolute milan me poor man my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable confederates so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples

the event then tell me if this might be a brother miranda i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs have borne bad sons prospero now the condition the king of naples being an enemy to me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit which was that he in lieu o the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon a treacherous army levied one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self miranda alack for pity i not remembering how i cried out then will cry it oer again it is a hint that wrings mine eyes tot prospero hear a little further

sea that roard to us to sigh to the winds whose pity sighing back again did us but loving wrong miranda alack what trouble was i then to you prospero o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have deckd the sea with drops full salt under my burthen groand which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue miranda how came we ashore prospero by providence divine some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan gonzalo out of his charity being then appointed master of this design did give us with rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries which since have steaded much so of his gentleness knowing i loved my books he furnishd me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my

antonio he misses not much sebastian no he doth but mistake the truth totally gonzalo but the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost beyond credit sebastian as many vouched rarities are gonzalo that our garments being as they were drenched in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather newdyed than stained with salt water antonio if but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies sebastian ay or very falsely pocket up his report gonzalo methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric at the marriage of the kings fair

alive to land alonso no no hes gone sebastian sir you may thank yourself for this great loss that would not bless our europe with your daughter but rather lose her to an african where she at least is banishd from your eye who hath cause to wet the grief ont alonso prithee peace sebastian you were kneeld to and importuned otherwise by all of us and the fair soul herself weighd between loathness and obedience at which end o the beam should bow we have lost your son i fear for ever milan and naples have more widows in them of this business making than we bring men to comfort them the faults your
